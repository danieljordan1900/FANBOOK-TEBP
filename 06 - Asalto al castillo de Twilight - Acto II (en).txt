The security system inside Twilight's Castle had been designed by Twilight herself a few weeks before moving to Canterlot, as part of the transfer of the place to Starlight Glimmer.

Since her student would soon be the headmistress of the School of Friendship, Twilight wanted to give her not just a house, but also a home where she could feel 'safe'. Of course, this was an over-the-top idea from Twilight, unconsciously born from the stress caused by her upcoming coronation as the ruler of Equestria. Even so, it was a rigorous task that went through up to five versions and four updates in its final form, the last of which was approved by Princess Luna.

Considering all the aforementioned, it could be safely said that it had not been an irresponsible planning.

However, she didn't have enough time to implement it and only left the blueprints to Starlight, along with a manual and other instructions on how to improve the castle in the future...

-----------------

[11:10 am]

The security room turned out to be one of the narrowest spaces in the castle, with a perimeter of barely 2x2 meters; it almost seemed like an 'expanded' version of a cleaning closet in comparison. And as if that wasn't enough, the space felt even smaller due to the security equipment, monitors, typewriters, cabinets, books, magical artifacts, and other clutter crammed inside. It was clear that the room couldn't accommodate more than 3 or 4 ponies.

Ocellus, sitting next to Smolder, didn't feel uncomfortable because of the narrowness of the place, but because of the mess surrounding her.

"There's not even a trash can..." thought Ocellus, frowning as she saw her dragon friend throw a piece of gum into a paper bag she found nearby. Ocellus had never been in that room before; previously, when her friends divided the tasks to watch the castle, she had preferred to check the weather and surroundings from one of the balconies. Gallus accompanied her, claiming he already knew the place, and they left their friends behind to divide the other tasks as they saw fit.

They hadn't been very cooperative with their friends at that moment; now, the situation was different.

"They're coming back," muttered Smolder, who was sitting in front of the monitors showing the castle's exterior. She turned her chair towards the door with the same ease as a business executive. Ocellus tried to mimic her, but the chair got stuck, forcing her to awkwardly adjust it on her own.

Just as she sat back down, the door of the control post opened, and Gallus and Silverstream entered.

Without wasting any time, Smolder was the first to speak.

"We saw everything that happened outside, Gallus, but these devices don't have audio, so we don't know what you talked about. Now, tell us, what was all that about?" Smolder asked inquisitively.

"I wish I didn't know," said Gallus, shaking his head. Beside him, Silverstream looked worried.

Gallus began recounting everything that had happened to his friends in detail. Smolder interrupted him several times with questions like "Did you really say that?" or "Didn't you ask this?" and more. Silverstream nodded at each interruption, helping to corroborate various details. Ocellus, on the other hand, remained silent. Sitting in her seat, the calm changeling just listened attentively to everything her friends were discussing.

Then, when Gallus finally finished his story, Ocellus spoke.

"So... that's what happened," said Ocellus, saddened.

"If that's how it was..." Gallus responded. "Aren't you going to scold me for not being more gentle with the counselor?"

"No," Ocellus replied, looking away.

Earlier, when she and her friends went to the security post alerted by the attack alarm, they discovered to their surprise that the cause had been none other than Counselor Trixie, who for unknown reasons had crashed into the castle's magical barrier.

That event sparked a short and heated discussion among them. Questions arose like: What is she doing here? Why did she do that? However, when the idea of helping her came up, Gallus stopped the conversation with a firm "Stop."

Gallus then reminded his friends of the agreement they had made with Starlight that morning. To ensure the group's school trip and to take care of the castle, they had to prevent Counselor Trixie from entering. Although he didn't fully understand the reasons, they had to respect the orders given; otherwise, they would jeopardize their long-awaited graduation trip.

This bothered Ocellus. She knew Gallus had adopted this tough stance not because he was concerned about the trip, but because of the grudge he held against the counselor.

Yes, Gallus was very upset with Trixie.

Days after the disastrous invasion of the orchid-octopuses, when the causes of the infestation at the school were being investigated, Gallus made a serious accusation blaming Counselor Trixie for what had happened. He declared that he and another friend had seen the counselor going to and from the school’s greenhouse late at night in a suspiciously furtive manner. Although his initial statements caused some commotion among the authorities, they lost weight soon after. When his companion from that night was asked if this was true, he replied that he wasn't sure if it was really Trixie or another pony. This was because it was very dark that day, and they had no illumination at the time. Adding to the fact that, unlike griffons, ponies don't have good night vision. Only Gallus had witnessed what happened.

Subsequently, other testimonies were collected describing sightings of the orchid-octopuses in the Everfree Forest around those days.

In the end, Trixie couldn't be held responsible for what happened due to lack of evidence. Although it left great suspicion, as it couldn’t be explained how the greenhouse, which had been closed during those dates, could have become infested.

Of course, this preliminary investigation result greatly angered Gallus, who for several days stayed away from the school and stayed with Sandbar at the hospital. Both had been on the front line of the orchid-octopus attack, and after a chaotic confrontation with the creatures, Sandbar ended up being captured by them and then used to attack his friends.

This clash among friends had a significant impact on Gallus, who after the incident began openly declaring to his friends that he would definitely make the responsible party pay for what had happened.

And now... that moment seemed to have arrived.

Ocellus considered the possibility of reproaching Gallus for his lack of kindness towards Trixie, but when she saw the counselor’s sorry state on the security cameras, she didn't have the heart to defend her. Ocellus didn’t like witnessing irresponsible behavior in adults, especially from someone in a school position. She was sure that the impeccable headmistress Starlight shared her perspective, so she didn't anticipate reprisals from the headmistress, even though she was such a good friend of Trixie's.

And about that last thing...

"Did the headmistress expect this to happen? Is that why she warned us not to let her in?" thought the changeling. "I have a bad feeling..."

Ocellus slightly shook her scaly wings, feeling a growing tension in the appendages of her tail. It was a sensation similar to what her body felt when a storm was approaching.

"Well, well, so the counselor partied too much last night? I’m not surprised, it would be the third time she’s done something like that as far as I remember," said Smolder, pensively looking at the ceiling of the room.

"Third time?" asked Ocellus and Silverstream, surprised.

"Oh come on, didn't I tell you? It was last year during the headmistress's birthday. They caused a whole commotion at the town hall when she entered the place trying to cash a check signed by Princess Luna. Ha, ha, ha," Smolder laughed cheerfully, vividly remembering what happened that day.

On that occasion, Smolder was present helping the mayor with various administrative tasks. Around noon, Trixie burst into the meeting room loudly claiming the invalidity of her check to everyone present. What happened next was predictable; it took at least ten security agents to contain her. Of course, this last part happened after the unicorn sang the Equestrian anthem on the mayor's desk.

"If only they had a video camera..." Smolder murmured nostalgically. Then, another thought crossed the dragon's mind. "Wait a moment... what happened to 'I’ll avenge my friend in the name of griffon honor' you kept repeating?" Smolder asked, raising an eyebrow and looking inquisitively at Gallus, who had just taken a seat.

Ocellus and Silverstream immediately turned to look at Gallus. What Smolder said was correct. Although Gallus had been very cold and distant with Trixie, it was surprising that he hadn't thrown the orchid-octopus incident in her face or shown all that anger he sporadically used to let out.

In his chair, a tired Gallus rolled his eyes exaggeratedly.

"Come on, I was just venting a little. It’s called anger dissipation. That's what they taught us in Professor Rainbow Dash's classes, remember? Besides, I'm not so attached to my people's old customs. I’m a free-thinking griffon," Gallus replied, puffing out his chest.

Smolder didn't say anything in response; instead, she gave her companion a skeptical look.

"All that's very nice, guys, but... what do we do now?" Silverstream suddenly said.

"I’ll talk to the counselor," Ocellus replied seriously. "Thank you for your help, Gallus, but it’s better if I talk to her from now on."

"Fine," Gallus responded with his characteristic indifference.

"I think that will have to wait," Silverstream said, looking at the equipment in the room.

"Why do you say that?" Smolder asked.

"She just left," Silverstream pointed out, indicating the empty exterior screens.

"Oh, she left? Well, we don't have to worry about her anymore then," Gallus added mockingly.

"Uhmm. I really wanted to talk to her. Which direction did she go?" Ocellus asked, thinking about sending a letter to Trixie.

"I'm not sure. Just when you arrived, the counselor opened her mouth wide as if she was screaming and then teleported," Silverstream replied, brimming with tranquility.

Creeping through the shadows, the unknown presence took up a new position.

The prey had escaped again. But he knew it would return. He just had to be patient.
