The intricate underground caves beneath the Everfree Forest were the last place one could imagine finding a pony taking a walk. Nevertheless, at that moment, there was a pony in that place. More precisely, a unicorn. Although she wasn't strolling through those tunnels adorned with precious gems.

Starlight Glimmer looked somewhat puzzled at the two tunnel forks where she stood. She didn't feel scared or lost; unlike other ponies, she was a capable unicorn who could fend for herself. One might even say you had to be careful not to make her angry, given her great skill in magic.

Starlight was strong, yet at that moment, she found herself in a little predicament.

"I don't remember this part," Starlight said aloud after checking her memories for the correct path.

It wasn't the first time she had traveled through these tunnels. In fact, she knew the way to her destination quite well. She had an exceptional memory, but right now, she was faced with a junction that shouldn't exist. Even the directions the tunnels were taking seemed strange to her.

The right tunnel delved into the depths of the earth, while the left tunnel seemed to zigzag its way up to the surface. Both the floor and the walls of the tunnels were perfectly natural and well-preserved, giving the impression that they had always been there.

"Uhm... Well... which one is the right way?" Starlight wondered to herself.

("When in doubt about the way, just follow your nose, hahaha. That's what Rarity taught me,") an old memory of Twilight joked when they had explored this place together.

Trusting her friend's memory, Starlight decided.

After a quick sniff, she sensed that the air in the left tunnel was cooler than in the other one. Without further thought, she continued on her way.

After several zigzags, the tunnel that had ascended throughout the journey suddenly descended again, and she soon found herself in a broader area of the caves covered with brightly colored orange stones.

Starlight smiled; this was an area of the caves she remembered.

Confident in the path she should now take, she continued quickly toward her destination.

The Festival of the Two Sisters was approaching. Starlight had promised everyone that she would attend this year's celebration at Maud Pie's house. Although she greatly appreciated her rock-studying friend, it wasn't just friendship that motivated her to be present on this occasion.

She didn't want to break her word once again. She had already missed too many parties to which she was invited by friends. The demanding workload as the headmare of the School of Friendship had increased alarmingly in the past year. The arrival of new students from the allied realms of Equestria and the resulting administrative problems, such as managing the travel of the new students, parent complaints, presiding over welcome ceremonies, occasional friendship issues, and a long list of other responsibilities had further reduced Starlight's already limited free time.


She didn't mind the extra work. She handled it very well, but she had less and less time for her friendships.

In particular, she had less time for a particular friend, a great friend to whom she couldn't just say 'I'm sorry.'

"May the heavens crush me if I don't arrive on time this time," Starlight scolded herself as she trotted. The unicorn had already started running out of impatience on her way to Maud's house.

As if the universe heard her words, an unexpected lump appeared out of nowhere and flattened her.

"Auuuughh, what the heck?" exclaimed an annoyed Starlight, who immediately got up, using her magic to move the lump that was on top of her.

"Coof, coof! Don't eat me! I don't taste good!" responded a flustered magician unicorn with a hat and cape.

"Trixie!" exclaimed Starlight in shock.

"Starlight?" Trixie responded in surprise, putting aside a cudgel she had conjured with her magic.

Starlight immediately released Trixie, and the two friends hugged each other.

"Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?" the lavender-maned unicorn asked with concern, stepping back to check on her friend.

"Everything's normal. Just a little dizzy. I've had worse falls," Trixie replied, taking off her hat and shaking her mane to remove the rocks that had stuck in her hair.

"But how did you get here? You came out of nowhere," said Starlight, looking at the ceiling in search of the hole through which Trixie should have fallen.

"Don't be so surprised. I simply used my great and powerful magic. I used teleportation," Trixie replied proudly while dusting off her hat.

"Underground?" Starlight responded skeptically. It was common knowledge that teleportation usually didn't work well underground, especially considering the Everfree Forest above them. It could be said that Trixie's decision had been very imprudent.

"I've got it covered. Besides, I did it because I planned to surprise our friends with an impressive and unexpected appearance in the middle of the party, so this accident only counts as a simple rehearsal."

"Of course... you really know how to make an entrance," Starlight said, pointing at her with her hoof, not entirely convinced by her friend's words.

"It's my trademark, dear," Trixie replied, finishing adjusting her hat and ready for action.

Both friends broke into short but cheerful laughter. It was clear that each knew what the other was thinking. Their friendship had grown enough to understand each other to that extent. Without further interruptions, they both continued their journey to Maud's house.

--------------------

"You really should have been there; the majestic gardens of Ponylonia are a true wonder of the ancient world," exclaimed an excited Trixie on her way to Maud's house.

"Yeah, I can imagine," responded Starlight, sounding somewhat bored and uncomfortable by her side.

They were getting close to Maud's house, and Starlight could be glad about that. Their conversation had shifted through various topics, from school matters and changes in the student body to Trixie's recent expedition across the Great Desert. Initially, Starlight had been happy to hear about her friend's great discoveries or, rather, the alternative tourism she had undertaken. However, the passion with which Trixie told these stories had started to scrape at the feelings of guilt that Starlight had buried.

Starlight had really wanted to accompany her, but a severe accident with the school's bio-garden had delayed her trip and ultimately left her with no choice but to cancel it.

Trixie had set out with Hoo'Far for Ponylonia on an expedition she had programmed and plotted the route for herself. While her friend discovered the secrets of an ancient wonder, Starlight had to deal with an outbreak of Brain-Eating Octo-Orchids gone wild.

"By the way, Trixie, I know you just got back from your trip a few days ago, but... do you have any idea how the bio-garden at the school got infested with Brain-Eating Octo-Orchids?" Starlight interrupted Trixie's monologue.

"I haven't the faintest idea," the unicorn responded immediately.

Starlight frowned. That immediate response wasn't what she wanted to hear. According to the testimonies of several students, someone had been entering the bio-garden during the night in the weeks leading up to the incident. The key to enter was in the care of the professor on duty, in this case, Trixie.

On top of this, there was Hoo'Far's intriguing comment about how happy her friend had been throughout the trip.

Starlight knew Trixie, and she didn't believe her friend had deliberately sabotaged the trip to keep her from joining. However, it was possible that she had 'accidentally' been conducting some unauthorized experiments in the bio-garden.

Starlight was aware of the personal projects Trixie had and how she had used school resources to carry them out in the past.

Using her position as headmistress, she had covered her flank back then with a promise not to do it again. But that promise seemed to have aged poorly.

"You know, I've been thinking about closing the bio-garden," Starlight said casually.

"No way!" Trixie exploded but quickly calmed down when she saw her friend's inquisitive look.

"I mean... as the student counselor, I think it would be very detrimental to the school. The bio-garden is a crucial environment in the students' development," Trixie continued in a more academic tone.

"Yes, I know, which is precisely why I plan to close it for some renovations to make it a more inclusive place for everyone."

"Oh, I see... When will you do it?" Trixie asked, looking at the wall.

"Probably by the end of next month, after the student graduation ceremony."

"Ah, yes, the ceremony," Trixie responded, who, on the other hand, with her magic, was taking notes of what Starlight had just told her.


Starlight had a pronounced frown as she gazed at Trixie.

"Uhmm, that reminds me. Starlight, how's the schedule for our next year's vacation coming along?" Trixie asked, turning to look at her friend.

A knot formed in Starlight's throat at that moment. A great concern she had been trying to hide returned to her like a cold shower. Without knowing what to say, she nervously looked ahead to find a way to divert the conversation.

Soon, she found a solution.

"Hey, look, we've arrived at Maud's house. Let's hurry!" Starlight suddenly said, pointing ahead. Without warning, she began to run toward the door of Maud's house, just a few dozen meters away.

"Wait, don't change the subject. I asked you how the schedule for our vacation is going. Wait!" Trixie shouted as she ran, trying to catch up to Starlight, who seemed to be trying to evade the conversation.

But Starlight was much faster, and soon a great distance separated them. Realizing that she wouldn't catch up, Trixie decided to play her trump card.

In a quick flash of her horn, Trixie teleported in front of her friend, right in front of the curtain door that served as the entrance to Maud's house.

Starlight came to an abrupt stop, her path blocked by Trixie.

"Hah, yes, about that... can we talk about it later?" Starlight finally responded, her voice filled with uncertainty.

Now it was Trixie who was frowning.

"If I recall correctly, you promised to make a great effort to find the right temporary head so we could finally have our incredible and long-delayed vacation, which we've been planning for the last three years!" Trixie exclaimed, almost shouting as she shot a disapproving look at Starlight. The sharp unicorn had already sensed that something was amiss with her friend's responses.

"It's not about that..." Starlight was biting her lip.

Trixie raised an eyebrow, noting the unexpected tension in Starlight. There was definitely something important she wanted to tell her. But if it was another excuse, like the many times before, she wouldn't let it slide this time.

Finally, Starlight sighed wearily and decided to drop the bomb.

"I'm not currently looking for someone to take on the temporary position, but someone for the permanent one. I'm thinking about stepping down from my role as headmistress of the School of Friendship," Starlight finally said with a completely serious look.

Starlight had already imagined the possible reactions from Trixie to this news. The great doubts and mental turmoil that her friend might be going through. She herself was still not entirely convinced of her own judgment, but if anyone could provide a better perspective to help her clear her thoughts, it would be her great friend...

"THAT'S WONDERFUL! HIIIIIIIIIIII!" Trixie exclaimed in a whinny and then gave Starlight a big hug.

"Wh-what!?" Starlight responded, shocked by her friend's immediate and accurate response.

"YES, I KNEW THAT ONE DAY YOU'D FINALLY DITCH THAT HORRIBLE JOB AND DEDICATE YOURSELF COMPLETELY TO MAGIC WITH ME!"

"Wait, that's not what you're thinking! This isn't about the job, I..." Starlight could hardly respond. In her head, she thought, "What happened to 'YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DIRECTOR POSITION' and 'I GIVE YOU MY FULL SUPPORT' that you always say to me!"

"Now we'll be able to spend more time together and go on adventures all over the place. WE'LL BE THE FIRST PONY FRIENDS TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE WORLD! YES, I CAN ALREADY SEE IT: 'THE GREAT AND INCREDIBLE EQUINE TOUR OF TRIXIE AND STARLIGHT AROUND THE WORLD'!" Trixie exclaimed almost hysterically, addressing some empty space in the cavern.

Starlight had to do something; the conversation was spiraling out of control.

Without much thought, Starlight ignited her horn and caught Trixie with her magic, who had started jumping with joy all around. "Trixie, calm down, you're not getting it!"

"Alright, alright... I understand. I know you're confused, but we have to accept changes when they come," said Trixie, patting Starlight's cheeks.

Starlight didn't know how to respond to those words.

Without further ado, Starlight sat down with a mute and distressed expression where she was. The conversation wasn't going the way she had hoped. Part of her really... wanted to cry.

Trixie stopped her joy abruptly, sensing the distress in her friend.

"What's wrong, Starlight? You don't seem so happy about this news."

"Do you even hear yourself? I'm not happy about this. You're not supposed to be so happy about this either. I haven't even made a final decision about it!" Starlight exclaimed with frustration, with tears welling up in her eyes.

"I'm sorry... I think I got carried away..." Trixie responded, setting aside her selfish joy. "Although you should've mentioned that from the beginning. Come to think of it, you haven't told me why you want to step down as headmistress."

"Isn't that exactly what you should've asked me from the beginning?" Starlight retorted, rubbing her eyes.

"Okay... I'm sorry... So, tell me, friend, why do you want to quit being the headmistress?" Trixie asked, taking a seat next to Starlight.

"Well... I..."

"Is it a health issue?" Trixie interjected, concerned.

"No," Starlight immediately responded.

"Uhm... Wait! Did Twilight order you to do it?" Trixie asked with a sharp and suspicious look, getting up.

"No, no."

"Uhm... So..." Now Trixie was genuinely confused.

"It's something... complicated," Starlight responded, resigned, looking away.

A silence hung between the two friends. Starlight no longer wanted to continue the conversation with Trixie. At least not for the moment. She now doubted whether sharing her true feelings with Trixie would actually help her become more certain of her decision. She had to admit it, she had made a mistake.

"This was a mistake. I think I shouldn't have told you like this," Starlight said, standing up.

"But what are you saying? If it's something important, you can trust me and tell me," said Trixie, now concerned, placing her hoof on her friend's shoulder.

"No, let's drop the subject for now. Don't worry, it's not something serious... tomorrow afternoon, I'll be free at Twilight's castle. I'll tell you everything then. Are you okay with that?" Starlight responded with a determined look, now certain of her decision.

"Uhmm, well, alright..." Trixie replied, somewhat annoyed. She didn't have time for this kind of drama. She preferred that important conversations be direct and to the point.

But when it came to Starlight, she was willing to accept it.

"But at least tell me what's going on. Is it about your job as the headmistress or is it about me?" Trixie continued.

"It's something very personal," Starlight declared with a serious look and a firm posture, making it clear that she no longer wanted to continue discussing that topic.

Trixie wasn't sure what Starlight could be referring to. She was quite close to her, so this behavior from her friend was very surprising. Starlight had left her past mistakes behind, regained the trust of others, and was now recognized as a great pony. In many ways, she had outdone herself, to the point that Trixie had even felt jealous of her. But, aside from the heavy workload her friend had as the headmistress of the School of Friendship, what could be going on now?

Honestly, Trixie wanted to continue the conversation.

At that moment, without warning, the door-curtain opened.

"Hello... come in," Maud Pie said with her characteristic indifferent posture before returning inside her home, leaving the door-curtain open for her friends.

Both Trixie and Starlight, surprised by the sudden reception, looked at each other, wondering if Maud had heard their entire conversation. They could see the inside of the party and noticed that most of the guests had already arrived. So, it was safe to assume that they were the last ones to arrive.

With the earlier discussion behind them, the relationship between the two friends continued as usual.

"Well, Maud seemed... somewhat... anxious. Could it be that Maudbriar hasn't arrived yet?" Starlight asked, somewhat inquisitive, watching Maud walk away.

"Do you think so?" Trixie asked, not having noticed anything different in the rock-loving, reserved pony.

It was common knowledge that Maud and Maudbriar were a perfect couple. However, there had been rumors months ago that they had a fight and had grown somewhat distant since then. Given how private that pair of ponies were, there was no way to confirm those rumors, but it was a fact that they weren't seen walking together as frequently as before.

In a corner of the crowded room, a solitary Maud sat, near a table, sipping a drink while petting Boulder.

"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get in already!" Starlight exclaimed, noticing they had been watching the party from the outside for quite a while. Her good mood had returned.

"After you, my great and powerful friend," Trixie responded confidently.

Both friends entered the party with smiles, only to be immediately greeted by a confetti explosion from Pinkie Pie.
