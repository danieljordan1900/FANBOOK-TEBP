Amidst the dense windless cloudiness enveloping snow-capped peaks, emerges the majestic figure of a bird.

It's an immense creature, with wings so expansive they resemble the outstretched arms of a giant; with every beat of its wings, it tears the clouds from their rest and scatters them in swirls that dissipate into the white horizon.

Despite its gigantic size, impossible for any other bird, the shapes of its talons and beak betray its true identity.

It's an eagle. It's Londrinel, silver-breasted, messenger of the giant eagles, returning from a mission with his kin.

Soaring over glaciers and snow-capped mountains, Londrinel continues his flight over a cloudy sea of whiteness and stillness. Advancing in a straight line, he catches sight of distant rocky peaks tinted blue and purple, protruding like castles floating in the sky. It's then that Londrinel alters his flight pattern; his wingbeats slow, and he ascends even higher above the clouds, silhouetted against a perfect blue sky.

Thus, within minutes, Londrinel halts his ascent and plunges into a dive towards the peaks that few mortals have reached. These unique rock formations in the world are known as the Amethyst Mountain Range peaks, the home of the giant eagles, and of course, Londrinel as well.

Paying no heed to the watchful gaze of his fellow eagles observing from the walls of colossal granite towers, Londrinel continues his descent towards the base of the largest tower, spreading his enormous wings to contain the air around him. He cushions his fall until finally landing in a large rocky bay at the foot of the great tower.

Thus, Londrinel concludes his flight and is then greeted by other eagles bearing a similar demeanor, maintaining a respectful distance and being observed by the sharp eyes of the guards. After a brief examination, they clear the way for Londrinel, who continues his path by hopping up the steps of the long spiral staircase surrounding the grand granite tower.

Hastily, Londrinel proceeds on foot. A behavior uncharacteristic of those mighty birds that rule the skies. Nevertheless, Londrinel feels no shame in walking; on the contrary, with each step, his reverence for this place grows. This grand tower he now ascends is a sacred place for all eagles, a place only "one" of all of them can reach by flying.

It is this great eagle that Londrinel seeks to present himself to.

Finally, the steps of the staircase end, and a vast space opens before him.

It is the peak of peaks, the highest pinnacle in all the Amethyst Range, the highest point on the entire continent. Here, the ground is white as snow, devoid of embellishments or other rocks to serve as seats. Everything is perfectly flat, as if a sword had cleaved through the rock itself. This is the celestial roof, the "white nest," the throne of the ruler of these summits.

Before Londrinel's sharp gaze stands the king of eagles. There stands Thargodal.

Barely noticing his imposing silhouette, Londrinel hastens forward towards his king and bows his head until it touches the ground itself with his beak. This is how eagles show their respect for their ruler.

However, Thargodal, who was standing with his back turned, gazing at the horizon, does not turn to look at him. Only a whistle, foreign to the wind, whispers in response.

Londrinel understands this signal and immediately gives his report to his king. In a language unintelligible to any other creature but an eagle, Londrinel informs his king of everything he has seen on his journey. He has flown over valleys and beaches, cities and towns, rivers and deserts. He has flown across the entire continent and yet has not found what his king asked him to find.

There is no trace of darkness on the land.

Of course, there are individuals that cause conflicts among the terrestrial creatures, and in the shadow of the night, nameless creatures roam the unexplored forests. But none of these presences are unknown to the eagles; they see everything, they are aware of the day-to-day lives of the creatures living under the sky. Always vigilant of any threat, the eagles are the guardians of peace on the continent.

King Thargodal knows this, for it is his will. So, Londrinel wonders: Why did his king ask for something like this? Being the most exceptional among them, with vision so profound it can pierce through clouds and rocks. So much so that it is even said he can see the future. The king himself, from his white throne, should be able to see it all.

But to Londrinel's rising doubts, there is no answer. His king remains silent.

Thargodal's attention is not on his subject but on the distant horizon. A fear grows in his heart.

Born from a recurring dream, a dark vision disturbs the monarch's peace. Thargodal, who has lived longer than any of his subjects, senses the approaching darkness, perceives the danger, but shrouded in shadows, he cannot see a complete picture of the threat.

Days pass, and the distant vision takes on an increasingly unsettling, clearer form. Thargodal feels that time is running out.

Midday of the longest day had arrived, and it was today. The image was nearly complete. However, despite Thargodal's exhaustive vigilance, no sign of danger had manifested on the land. He feared the worst: that the impending disaster was inevitable.

Thargodal loved peace, he loved the peace of his people above all else. He was willing to do anything to protect them. However, he could not alarm his subjects without cause. Fear should not rule his people, but order.

Thus, while Thargodal kept his back to Londrinel, these deliberations took place within him.

Suddenly, something unexpected happened...

In response to the king's thoughts, a call traversed the sky. It spread like lightning and was heard by all the eagles. It originated from the surface and ascended to reach Thargodal's white throne.

Londrinel heard it and lifted his head, confused. Thargodal also heard it and immediately fixed his gaze in the direction of the origin of that call. His gaze pierced through the clouds and material obstacles, wandering across the continent until it reached the distant land ruled by the ponies. There, he observed who was making the call, contemplated what had happened, was happening, and would happen in that place. Then, Thargodal knew what to do next.

He spread his wings and let out a powerful cry from his throne. Surprise invaded Londrinel at this sudden change, but his astonishment was short-lived. His king turned around and regarded him sternly, without a trace of doubt, crowned by the dew of starlight and the brilliance of midday. Thargodal spoke to him.

The new orders that reached him were clear and undeniable.

"All eagles must gather immediately. Midnight is approaching..."

Around Twilight's castle...

Sunburst trotted slowly along the path, with several papers floating around him as he carefully reviewed the school budget plans for the new academic period.

"...if we reduce the number of school trips in the first quarter and focus on localized social projects in a single city, we might be able to save enough funds to cover the expenses for repairs in the biogarden. On the other hand, we could ask the town hall for a loan, but the interest rate is too high when it comes to repairs. If it were an entirely new construction, we could get a payment plan of up to 10 years..."

No one was accompanying Sunburst, so he was "talking" to himself, as was usual for those who knew him. However, his ability to read multiple documents without taking his eyes off them while moving was astonishing.

The carefree unicorn continued along the path. He was heading to meet Starlight, as he had a meeting with her in the afternoon. Although these meetings outside of school usually covered everyday topics, this time he would have to address "very serious academic matters," such as the "terrible fact" that the order of the annexes in the school budget for the next period did not match the index of the printed document, or the "baffling case" that the funding proposals had much less detailed charts than expected.

These findings had worried Sunburst, who constantly reviewed Starlight's work. If Twilight were there, she would surely support this conviction firmly. Although, considering how festive the day was, it might be considered somewhat inopportune...

"...maybe I should ask Starlight to review the school budget again tomorrow. I don't think it's okay as it is..."

Sunburst stopped mid-musing. His ability to walk while reading alerted him to an obstacle ahead.

Looking up, he encountered something "unexpected." A little further ahead was the castle, protected by a magical barrier in case of attack. Outside the barrier was Trixie's trailer and a gray-coated pegasus.

Puzzled by what might be happening, Sunburst quickened his pace.

"What's going on?" Sunburst asked as he approached the trailer.
