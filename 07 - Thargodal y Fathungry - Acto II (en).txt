"Ahhh, what bliss..." murmured Trixie. Resting, that was all her body longed for at that moment.

Lying on a green meadow, under a blue sky dotted with lazily floating white clouds, listening to her favorite music and wrapped in the warm embrace of midday. Trixie, with her eyes closed behind sunglasses, imagined herself in such a place at that moment.

A calm and wonderful day, which could even get better, as she was not alone.

Her best friend was with her, Starlight was...

No.

Trixie opened her eyes abruptly. Her vivid dream was not yet over.

She wasn't where she had imagined. Remote, distant, and nebulous, the unicorn found herself sitting in the middle of a cosmic corridor full of doors.

"Where?" Trixie's confused voice got lost in the emptiness of the hallway, with echoes bursting into different tones and emotions.

Then, a headache overcame her and Trixie's memory refreshed. Her mental confusion (caused by fatigue, stress, and the red potions she had drunk) had considerably decreased. Lucid, she could remember that this was the same place she had dreamed of the previous night. That disturbing nightmare.

"Was it all just a dream?" Trixie exclaimed hopefully. There was a great possibility that it was, nothing that had happened that morning could be considered routine in her day-to-day life. The castle barrier, the corrupt potions, the ghosts, the manticore, the hawk-turkeys... she had experienced so many things in the last few hours, more than she had lived in the last three years.

Like a flower opening to the sun, Trixie's face transformed, filling with a single emotion: joy.

"Hahahahaha!" Trixie burst into laughter that echoed throughout the hallway. She pounded the ground with her hooves and soon fell on her back from the excitement. She didn't need to think about it anymore. It had all been a dream!

The fights, the pain, the anger... none of it had really happened.

This was just a dream.

Trixie continued laughing and almost crying on the hallway floor for a long time, happy that none of her questionable actions had been real. She continued this way until her passionate feelings gradually calmed down.

Slowly, she became aware of herself and her strange situation again...

Worried once more, Trixie immediately stood up.

The cosmic corridor she was in remained just as desolate and unchanged.

"Ahem... Hello! Is anyone there?" Trixie asked, her voice getting lost in the infinity.

There was no response, just more echoes.

"Okay... fine! Trixie... this is just a dream, just stay calm and you'll be safe."

She wasn't really sure where to go or who to expect. She vaguely remembered the mysterious pony who had guided her before in that place, but now she didn't think about her. Standing still, waiting in uncertainty, was not an option for Trixie.

Distrustfully, she began to move down the hallway, the white light from the doors on either side illuminating her path.

"Oh, I remember now... uhmmm, each door leads to a memory of mine, right?" Curious, Trixie peeked through one of the doors...

"Is Counselor Trixie dead?" Sandbar spoke with a trembling voice.

A crushing silence enveloped the main hallway of Twilight's Castle, where all the members of the Young Six were gathered. Their faces reflected a mix of bitterness and disbelief.

"It can't be so. Counselor Trixie is very skilled, she must have escaped with some trick!" Yona tried to deny.

"No, Yona. I saw her fall among the hawk-turkeys myself and disappear into Fathungry's beak. There's no way anyone could escape from that..." Gallus responded dejectedly, sitting on the floor. Regret was evident in his words.

Ocellus and Smolder were speechless at that moment, still processing what Gallus had told them.

"This can't be happening," murmured Silverstream.

Despite her flaws and eccentricities, no one would have wished for Trixie Lulamoon's life to end that way.

The silence continued after the hippogriff's words. The possible loss of their substitute teacher, student counselor, and friend weighed heavily on all of them.

Then, amidst that feeling of desolation, one of them looked up.

Sandbar, in his wheelchair, without asking for help from his companions, moved towards the castle door and carefully opened it to see outside.

Outside, just a few meters away, a dozen burly hawk-turkeys were avidly pecking at the beautiful flowers surrounding the castle, crushing ornamental arrangements and destroying the few decorations that remained from the Festival of the Two Sisters.

"What are you doing?" Gallus finally asked, raising his head, the others followed suit.

"I must... no. We must go and retrieve Counselor Trixie!" Sandbar exclaimed to his companions. Despite his delicate state, there was great strength in his voice.

Astonished looks followed the pony's words.

"Didn't you hear what I said? It's over! The counselor is..."

"Inside the gullet of the most dangerous hawk-turkey in Equestria. Yes! I understood perfectly, Gallus. That's why we must go!"

"It's madness..." Gallus replied, extremely serious.

"I hate to say it, but Gallus is right. We can't face those guys alone," added Smolder. "We must wait for the princess and the royal guard to come..."

"They'll take too long to arrive. We're already here, we can handle this."

"That's very brave of you, Sandbar, but... how are we supposed to deal with a horde of giant hawk-turkeys?" Silverstream asked alarmed.

"I'd like to know that too," added Gallus.

"Well... there's always a way... there must be!" Sandbar replied haltingly. He didn't have an answer for that; he hadn't thought it through that much before. Hopeful, he turned his gaze to the one who could answer that.

Ocellus, who had been silent all that time, felt the weight of Sandbar's gaze immediately, not just his, but also that of her other companions. Enormous pressure arose within her; her friends needed an answer from the one person they could trust to determine if it was possible to carry out that dangerous rescue mission.

Her decision would determine Trixie's fate.

Ocellus took a deep breath and then exhaled. Just as she had learned from her teachers, she set aside her emotions and coldly began to calculate the possible solutions to the serious problem they were in.

It didn't take long for her to find the obvious answer.

"There is a way. If we use the power of the Elements of Harmony that exists within us, we could make our way through the hawk-turkeys and rescue Counselor Trixie," she answered decisively.

"Whoooo!" the rest of the Young Six responded in unison, none of them had thought of that possibility. Since Twilight's coronation, they had barely used that power a couple of times.

The discouragement that had dominated the Young Six's spirits vanished; they all now shared words of encouragement and optimism.

All except a bitter and blue griffon.

"Do you really want to do this?" Gallus asked Sandbar coldly, interrupting the atmosphere.

"Yes, we are responsible for this happening, we must fix it."

"Even when she is the reason you ended up in this state?" Gallus continued without averting his gaze, pointing with one of his claws at the wheelchair where Sandbar was convalescing.

"Yes," Sandbar replied even more firmly.

The two friends exchanged cold looks for a tense moment.

Until finally...

"Ahhhhhhhhhh," Gallus exhaled, tilting his head and stepping aside.

"Any problem, Gallus?" Sandbar asked with a smile. To him and the rest of his friends, it was obvious how difficult it was for Gallus to accept Sandbar's good heart. A heart so noble that it was simply unbearable to the griffon.

And this very thing was the reason why he respected him so much.

With his back to his friends, Gallus muttered unintelligible things while swishing his tail from side to side. Then, without warning, he turned around.

"What are you all staring at? Let's go already! Let's show those pigeons they shouldn't mess with the friends of the first class of the School of Friendship!" Gallus exclaimed to the others, puffing out his chest and spreading his wings to the fullest.

With everyone's spirits high, the Young Six formed a line, holding hooves and claws, the group of friends moved forward.

The castle doors opened wide, outside the hawk-turkeys let out threatening squawks, inside the bond of those young friends materialized into unparalleled magic.

The Young Six took the first step... and a rainbow light enveloped everything.

//--------------

The light from the door went out, and the image of the Young Six faded. With no strength in her legs, Trixie, unable to believe what she had just witnessed, fell sitting down abruptly in front of the entrance.

"Am I dead...?" Trixie murmured in a barely audible voice, an expression of disbelief on her face.

There were many things that had scared Trixie throughout her life: crocodiles, giant spiders, piled-up bills, etc. However, these fears had only caused a moderate impact on her. Once Trixie finished releasing her passionate emotions, she could quickly adapt to the situation.

But the fear that was beginning to arise within her was something entirely new.

Her own death...

A metallic taste began to flood Trixie's mouth. At the same time, her stomach tightened her chest, causing her to hunch over and breathe with increasing difficulty.

"No, no, wait Trixie... It's a dream, of course!" the unicorn exploded in denial, standing up immediately. "None of that happened! You're not dead, Trixie, you're just having a crazy, very realistic dream. You drank a lot of cider last night, remember? You'll get out of this as always!"

Thus, Trixie spoke to herself with joy and enthusiasm. With a click of her hooves, she began to gallop down the hallway.
