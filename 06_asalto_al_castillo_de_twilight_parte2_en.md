The security system inside Twilight's Castle had been designed by Twilight herself a few weeks before moving to Canterlot, as part of the transfer of the place to Starlight Glimmer.

Since her student would soon be the headmistress of the School of Friendship, Twilight wanted to give her not just a house, but also a home where she could feel 'safe'. Of course, this was an over-the-top idea from Twilight, unconsciously born from the stress caused by her upcoming coronation as the ruler of Equestria. Even so, it was a rigorous task that went through up to five versions and four updates in its final form, the last of which was approved by Princess Luna.

Considering all the aforementioned, it could be safely said that it had not been an irresponsible planning.

However, she didn't have enough time to implement it and only left the blueprints to Starlight, along with a manual and other instructions on how to improve the castle in the future...

-----------------

[11:10 am]

The security room turned out to be one of the narrowest spaces in the castle, with a perimeter of barely 2x2 meters; it almost seemed like an 'expanded' version of a cleaning closet in comparison. And as if that wasn't enough, the space felt even smaller due to the security equipment, monitors, typewriters, cabinets, books, magical artifacts, and other clutter crammed inside. It was clear that the room couldn't accommodate more than 3 or 4 ponies.

Ocellus, sitting next to Smolder, didn't feel uncomfortable because of the narrowness of the place, but because of the mess surrounding her.

"There's not even a trash can..." thought Ocellus, frowning as she saw her dragon friend throw a piece of gum into a paper bag she found nearby. Ocellus had never been in that room before; previously, when her friends divided the tasks to watch the castle, she had preferred to check the weather and surroundings from one of the balconies. Gallus accompanied her, claiming he already knew the place, and they left their friends behind to divide the other tasks as they saw fit.

They hadn't been very cooperative with their friends at that moment; now, the situation was different.

"They're coming back," muttered Smolder, who was sitting in front of the monitors showing the castle's exterior. She turned her chair towards the door with the same ease as a business executive. Ocellus tried to mimic her, but the chair got stuck, forcing her to awkwardly adjust it on her own.

Just as she sat back down, the door of the control post opened, and Gallus and Silverstream entered.

Without wasting any time, Smolder was the first to speak.

"We saw everything that happened outside, Gallus, but these devices don't have audio, so we don't know what you talked about. Now, tell us, what was all that about?" Smolder asked inquisitively.

"I wish I didn't know," said Gallus, shaking his head. Beside him, Silverstream looked worried.

Gallus began recounting everything that had happened to his friends in detail. Smolder interrupted him several times with questions like "Did you really say that?" or "Didn't you ask this?" and more. Silverstream nodded at each interruption, helping to corroborate various details. Ocellus, on the other hand, remained silent. Sitting in her seat, the calm changeling just listened attentively to everything her friends were discussing.

Then, when Gallus finally finished his story, Ocellus spoke.

"So... that's what happened," said Ocellus, saddened.

"If that's how it was..." Gallus responded. "Aren't you going to scold me for not being more gentle with the counselor?"

"No," Ocellus replied, looking away.

Earlier, when she and her friends went to the security post alerted by the attack alarm, they discovered to their surprise that the cause had been none other than Counselor Trixie, who for unknown reasons had crashed into the castle's magical barrier.

That event sparked a short and heated discussion among them. Questions arose like: What is she doing here? Why did she do that? However, when the idea of helping her came up, Gallus stopped the conversation with a firm "Stop."

Gallus then reminded his friends of the agreement they had made with Starlight that morning. To ensure the group's school trip and to take care of the castle, they had to prevent Counselor Trixie from entering. Although he didn't fully understand the reasons, they had to respect the orders given; otherwise, they would jeopardize their long-awaited graduation trip.

This bothered Ocellus. She knew Gallus had adopted this tough stance not because he was concerned about the trip, but because of the grudge he held against the counselor.

Yes, Gallus was very upset with Trixie.

Days after the disastrous invasion of the orchid-octopuses, when the causes of the infestation at the school were being investigated, Gallus made a serious accusation blaming Counselor Trixie for what had happened. He declared that he and another friend had seen the counselor going to and from the school’s greenhouse late at night in a suspiciously furtive manner. Although his initial statements caused some commotion among the authorities, they lost weight soon after. When his companion from that night was asked if this was true, he replied that he wasn't sure if it was really Trixie or another pony. This was because it was very dark that day, and they had no illumination at the time. Adding to the fact that, unlike griffons, ponies don't have good night vision. Only Gallus had witnessed what happened.

Subsequently, other testimonies were collected describing sightings of the orchid-octopuses in the Everfree Forest around those days.

In the end, Trixie couldn't be held responsible for what happened due to lack of evidence. Although it left great suspicion, as it couldn’t be explained how the greenhouse, which had been closed during those dates, could have become infested.

Of course, this preliminary investigation result greatly angered Gallus, who for several days stayed away from the school and stayed with Sandbar at the hospital. Both had been on the front line of the orchid-octopus attack, and after a chaotic confrontation with the creatures, Sandbar ended up being captured by them and then used to attack his friends.

This clash among friends had a significant impact on Gallus, who after the incident began openly declaring to his friends that he would definitely make the responsible party pay for what had happened.

And now... that moment seemed to have arrived.

Ocellus considered the possibility of reproaching Gallus for his lack of kindness towards Trixie, but when she saw the counselor’s sorry state on the security cameras, she didn't have the heart to defend her. Ocellus didn’t like witnessing irresponsible behavior in adults, especially from someone in a school position. She was sure that the impeccable headmistress Starlight shared her perspective, so she didn't anticipate reprisals from the headmistress, even though she was such a good friend of Trixie's.

And about that last thing...

"Did the headmistress expect this to happen? Is that why she warned us not to let her in?" thought the changeling. "I have a bad feeling..."

Ocellus slightly shook her scaly wings, feeling a growing tension in the appendages of her tail. It was a sensation similar to what her body felt when a storm was approaching.

"Well, well, so the counselor partied too much last night? I’m not surprised, it would be the third time she’s done something like that as far as I remember," said Smolder, pensively looking at the ceiling of the room.

"Third time?" asked Ocellus and Silverstream, surprised.

"Oh come on, didn't I tell you? It was last year during the headmistress's birthday. They caused a whole commotion at the town hall when she entered the place trying to cash a check signed by Princess Luna. Ha, ha, ha," Smolder laughed cheerfully, vividly remembering what happened that day.

On that occasion, Smolder was present helping the mayor with various administrative tasks. Around noon, Trixie burst into the meeting room loudly claiming the invalidity of her check to everyone present. What happened next was predictable; it took at least ten security agents to contain her. Of course, this last part happened after the unicorn sang the Equestrian anthem on the mayor's desk.

"If only they had a video camera..." Smolder murmured nostalgically. Then, another thought crossed the dragon's mind. "Wait a moment... what happened to 'I’ll avenge my friend in the name of griffon honor' you kept repeating?" Smolder asked, raising an eyebrow and looking inquisitively at Gallus, who had just taken a seat.

Ocellus and Silverstream immediately turned to look at Gallus. What Smolder said was correct. Although Gallus had been very cold and distant with Trixie, it was surprising that he hadn't thrown the orchid-octopus incident in her face or shown all that anger he sporadically used to let out.

In his chair, a tired Gallus rolled his eyes exaggeratedly.

"Come on, I was just venting a little. It’s called anger dissipation. That's what they taught us in Professor Rainbow Dash's classes, remember? Besides, I'm not so attached to my people's old customs. I’m a free-thinking griffon," Gallus replied, puffing out his chest.

Smolder didn't say anything in response; instead, she gave her companion a skeptical look.

"All that's very nice, guys, but... what do we do now?" Silverstream suddenly said.

"I’ll talk to the counselor," Ocellus replied seriously. "Thank you for your help, Gallus, but it’s better if I talk to her from now on."

"Fine," Gallus responded with his characteristic indifference.

"I think that will have to wait," Silverstream said, looking at the equipment in the room.

"Why do you say that?" Smolder asked.

"She just left," Silverstream pointed out, indicating the empty exterior screens.

"Oh, she left? Well, we don't have to worry about her anymore then," Gallus added mockingly.

"Uhmm. I really wanted to talk to her. Which direction did she go?" Ocellus asked, thinking about sending a letter to Trixie.

"I'm not sure. Just when you arrived, the counselor opened her mouth wide as if she was screaming and then teleported," Silverstream replied, brimming with tranquility.

------

Creeping through the shadows, the unknown presence took up a new position.

The prey had escaped again. But he knew it would return. He just had to be patient.

------

[11:10 am]

In the vicinity of the School of Friendship, on a calm and relaxing morning...

"SPLATTTTTTTTTTT." With a kick, Trixie opened the door of her trailer, shaking its entire interior; without losing a second, she plunged into the large disorganized pile that was her belongings.

She needed to find something immediately. She needed it.

"WHERE IS IT? HIC! WHERE? HIC!" the unicorn muttered vehemently, lifting a box of billiard balls. With the same desperation as a diamond dog in a coal mine, she made her way through boxes, books, and other piled-up packages.

Then, finally, she found it.

"AH-HA! HIC! Here you are! HIC! I knew I would need you one day! HIC! ... HAAAAAAAAAA! STUPID HICCUP! HIC!" Trixie exclaimed, beside herself in a sudden fit of frustration, kicking the ground. The hiccup she had gotten a moment earlier refused to leave her.

Annoyed by her state, she carelessly lifted the dusty box she had found and, quickly, dashed outside. Once outside, between hiccups and coughs caused by the dust, she immediately tore off the box's cover, revealing its true content.

It wasn't a box.

Among the multitude of exotic belongings she possessed, Trixie had one that could very well be her greatest and darkest secret, one that even Starlight barely knew existed.

In front of Trixie was a wooden chest that exuded antiquity. Visible between the hinges and metal edges covered by rust, the brilliant work of the carpenter who had made it could still be seen. Although its size, equal to that of a wallet, would make anyone think that the treasure it concealed, no matter how valuable, would end up being something very small. This last assumption would be naive and mistaken, as it masked its true magical nature.

Indeed, this was a magical chest, a very valuable and secret one that Trixie hadn't used in a long time. Moreover, she had sworn never to use it again.

"Click, Click..." with her magic, an anxious Trixie opened the enchanted lock of the chest and a moment later, the lid opened.

It was like a black oyster lazily opening to the sun, or rather like a tomb. Inside, something akin to a scarlet light seeped out.

Trixie's eyes sparkled, reflecting the malicious glow emanating from within. A long collection of identical red potions lay inside the chest. Stacked one on top of the other, the potions in small glass bottles were arranged within a mirrored background that gave the impression of containing the same infinity.

This was more than a simple optical illusion; it was a true magical mechanism that infinitely replicated those mysterious red potions hidden inside the chest. A magic with a very useful and unsettling purpose.

"Hic! Now you'll see what happens, Hic!, WHEN YOU ANGER THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE! Hic!" Trixie proclaimed proudly, displaying a malicious smile on an even more contorted face. She uncorked one of the potions and, determined, brought it to her mouth ready to drink it immediately.

However, she held back. About to drink the potion, the cold contact of the glass with her lips made her freeze, experiencing a brief moment of lucidity.

Suddenly, on her right shoulder, the vivid image of a small Trixie representing the good within her appeared. With a soft and gentle voice, the tiny imaginary figure spoke to her from the depths of her conscience.

"Trixie, don't do it. You're angry and scared about what might happen to Starlight, but you don't have to go this far. This is not what she would want from you. We need to calm down first," the angelic Trixie said with serenity and firmness.

In response, another figure immediately appeared on her left shoulder. This was the Trixie that represented the evil within her. With a deep and violent voice, she answered her counterpart.

"Calm down? Where have you been all morning? Starlight's future could be at stake, our reputation is already at stake, the students have turned against us, and time is running out! We have to fight back now!" ordered the furious diabolical Trixie.

"This is not the right way to do things," replied the good Trixie.

"This is the way of the great and powerful Trixie!" exploded the bad Trixie.

"No, it's not," retorted the good Trixie with an arrogant stance.

"Yes, it is!" replied the fiery bad Trixie.

"No, it isn't," insisted the good Trixie, now sticking out her tongue.

"YES, IT IS!" the bad Trixie exploded in flames.

Caught in the middle of this absurd fictional argument was a bewildered Trixie, who had no idea what was happening.

"Enough... Hic! Where did you come from? Hic! Go away!" With just a shake of her mane, both imaginary figures disappeared from her sides. However, despite her hallucinations having left, she continued shaking her head wildly until, in a bad move, she stumbled and clumsily fell to the ground.

Sprawled out in the grass, with turf in her mouth and in an awkward position, Trixie suddenly murmured very lost: "This is too much."

Trixie wasn't thinking clearly, or rather, she wasn't thinking at all... the night before she had consumed too much cider and had skipped breakfast in the morning. Her body woke up heavy, and despite this, she had rushed without brakes to Twilight's castle. Now, with an irritated horn, her head was starting to ache.

She had reached her limit.

With much effort, a dizzy Trixie straightened up and sat down dejectedly. Distracted, she directed her gaze towards the castle.

There, in the distance, was the home of her great friend, Starlight Glimmer. The first pony she recognized as a true friend. The same pony who assisted in her circus acts despite being a more skilled sorceress than she was. The pony who fulfilled her role as the school’s headmistress in an exemplary manner and had chosen her as her closest advisor...

And now, because of her terrible decisions, she was about to ruin that friendship.

(Aren’t I supposed to give everything to protect that bond?) Trixie thought wearily.

Not long ago, the Young Six had blocked her, preventing her from entering the castle to see Starlight. Not only that, she found out that Starlight was already in a meeting with Chancellor Neighsay, which confirmed her worst fears.

Distressed, she returned to her trailer, so scared and angry that the crazy idea of using that old potion chest she had forbidden herself from using surfaced in her mind. However, thanks to her fatigue, she was now starting to calm down. In the midst of all this, she no longer felt so confident about continuing with that idea.

"Ahhh Hic!... what should I do now? Hic!" Trixie murmured disheartened.

Trixie longed to return, to barge into Starlight’s meeting with the chancellor immediately. She needed to tell her friend how sorry she was, to confess that it was all her fault.

But she couldn’t; the castle was closed to her, guarded by those meddlesome kids...

"Hic! Ahhh why do these things happen to me?... Hic!" Trixie protested, in the middle of her stubborn hiccups and renewed frustration that was starting to overwhelm her.

If it weren’t for that nightmare, probably none of this would be bothering her so much, and she’d be resting peacefully in her trailer... drinking cider with oatmeal pancakes...

Trixie’s stomach emitted an unmistakable growl. Trying to ignore the growing hunger manifesting inside her, she diverted her gaze towards the red potion she was holding with her magic. The eerie glow of the potion flickered amidst a disturbing whisper, urging her to consume it immediately.

Trixie rolled her eyes, bored.

"Yes, yes, I know, Hic! you’re evil and you’ll give me the power I need to do what I want Hic!" Trixie spoke annoyed to the potion; it obviously didn’t respond and continued to glow with its hypnotic light. "On the other hand... Hic! I guess if I don’t use you now, Hic! it wouldn’t make sense to have kept you all this time. Hic!"

Trixie, tired of thinking, didn’t give the matter any more thought. She uncorked the potion with her magic and brought it to her mouth.

She drank its contents in one gulp.

The potion spilled inside her, causing a strange sensation of warmth that quickly transformed into an eruption of heat that flooded her completely. A crimson magic enveloped her figure like a burning flame; instantly, her hiccups and fatigue vanished. Strength and vitality filled her completely, restoring that proud demeanor that so characterized her.

The great and powerful Trixie was back.

"Yes, I can feel it now," Trixie murmured, observing the glow of her own figure. Filled with the noxious and powerful magic coursing through her body, she looked towards her trailer. Her mind was buzzing with violent ideas about her next move. Such was the effect of the crimson potion that it reduced morality and reason in exchange for power.

So, for Trixie, everything was clear now; since she hadn’t been allowed to enter the castle, she would create her own path by force.

"Uhmm... maybe I just need to take what’s necessary... no, on second thought. I’ll take everything!" the unicorn exclaimed fervently.

With a single move of her horn, the trailer and Trixie rose into the air. And, after a sudden flash of magic, they disappeared.

------

[11:25 am]

On one of the balconies of Twilight’s castle...

“Wait... LESSON? The 'Laughable Enforcement Squadron for the Suppression and Nullification of Orchid Octopi'?” Sandbar exclaimed, surprised as he read the newspaper Yona had handed him.

“Professor Pie insist very much on that name.”

“It sounds very forced,” commented Sandbar as he scratched his head.

“Yona agree, but name’s acronym very funny,” Yona responded cheerfully with a smile. Sandbar returned the smile and continued reading the newspaper.

Leaving her friend focused on his reading, Yona began to check the bag behind Sandbar’s wheelchair. She found the lunches she had prepared for her friends and, after examining them for a moment, confirmed that they were well sealed and still warm. Satisfied, she closed the bag, not before returning the cups and thermos she had previously taken out.

Noon was approaching.

“Lunch time near. Better head towards friends so not be late for lunch.”

“Yeah, we better get going. I don’t think there’s anything else we need to do here,” replied Sandbar, immediately putting away the newspaper he had.

Both Yona and Sandbar had accepted the task of keeping watch around the castle from the balcony. This would have been a more appropriate job for Smolder or Gallus; however, due to certain incidents that had happened among their companions, they had ended up with this task.

Sandbar, who was in his wheelchair, observed the imposing magical barrier surrounding the castle. Although it was an impressive sight from the inside, it failed to instill a sense of security in him. The scars from his recent accident were still fresh in his body and mind. An unsettling tingling persisted in his hind legs...

Suddenly, his field of vision darkened. Something warm and fluffy enveloped his face. Trapped by the memories of his previous trauma, Sandbar panicked and was about to scream. However, he stopped himself when he recognized the playful laughter behind him. It was clear who the culprit was.

“Yona!” Sandbar complained.

“Friend Sandbar should not be too tense, should laugh more, be safe among friends now,” laughed the large Yak, removing her big hooves from Sandbar’s field of vision and giving him a loving hug.

“Yes, it’s fine. I understand. I should be more cheerful. The doctor said so, but it’s very difficult for me... I still feel those things on me at night. Haaa... I wish I were as strong as you, Yona.”

“Sandbar is strong, but he is hurt. Yona will help him heal,” responded Yona, giving him a small kiss on the forehead.

Sandbar, moved, was about to respond to Yona when...

It was sudden.

The magical barrier flickered and then a thunderous crash resounded. Surprised, the pair of friends quickly looked down from the balcony in the direction of the crash.

In front of the castle doors, the magical barrier rippled as if it had been struck by a giant hammer. However, only a small figure was there...

------

[11:30 am]

A bolt of red magic struck the magical barrier of Twilight's castle, shaking it to its core with impressive force. The light emanating from that violent assault, resembling a giant welding arc from a distance, would have been visible even in Canterlot if the angle of its glow had been favorable.

The one responsible for such a colossal display of power was none other than Trixie herself, wearing her cape and hat.

After a long minute of continuous attack that seemed like an eternity, the powerful beam of magic finally relented.

“Ha... Ha... Still not down? ...,” Trixie murmured under her breath, panting in front of the barrier. Things were not going as she had expected. Bringing down the barrier with her powerful magic and then triumphantly entering the castle had been her initial plan. But despite her formidable effort, the barrier still stood like an impregnable wall.

This infuriated Trixie greatly, but there was something that enraged her even more.

“AND YOU, KIDS, I KNOW YOU’RE IN THERE! I WARN YOU, DON’T MAKE ME ANGRIER, LOWER THE BARRIER NOW AND I PROMISE YOUR PUNISHMENT WILL BE LESS SEVERE THAN IT ALREADY IS!” Trixie shouted with eyes filled with corrupt red magic.

There was no response.

Trixie knew she was making a big scene outside the castle; it was impossible for the Young Six not to have noticed. However, until that moment, they had not made themselves present.

“FINE!” Trixie screamed, exploding with impatience, snorted loudly, and waved her horn defiantly. Behind her, the door of the trailer she had brought opened, and several objects floated out in a line, parading in front of her.

“Umhhh, let’s see... Good, but no... no... no... What’s this doing here! no...,” Trixie carelessly enumerated the most dangerous objects she had inside her trailer. C-4 explosives, bee-bear traps, enchanting scrolls, a Twilight plushie (which was immediately thrown in the trash), a black eucalyptus-everfang root, a scream-eagle horn, among others.

Despite the danger of these objects, Trixie didn’t seem convinced to use any until...

“Aha,” exclaimed the unicorn. Sending the other objects back into her trailer with a quick gesture of her horn, Trixie set one aside and brought it closer to her with a malicious smile.

“It’s time to use heavy artillery...” Trixie reasoned, excited about what she was going to do next.

The object Trixie would use to bring down the magical barrier was an ancient urn.

But this wasn’t just any antique.

The ancient urn, as large as Trixie’s own head, had a body similar to a clay jug, looking old and battered that would go unnoticed at first glance. However, in its wide mouth was a fine and long piece of yellow paper attached, resembling a large tag. On this paper were printed, in black ink, intricate illegible characters of a forgotten language. For someone knowledgeable about the ancient world, it was clear that this was a talisman serving as a seal and a warning to anyone who dared to open that relic.

Of course, Trixie didn’t care about this at all and removed the seal immediately. Confident in the power she held in her hooves, she advanced toward the magical barrier, holding the urn high, and then proclaimed:

“GHOSTS OF EULFALIA! I, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE, RELEASE YOU! MANIFEST AND SERVE ME!” her voice echoed loudly, while the unicorn radiated the light of her magic around her. Nature fell silent at that moment. Everyone who could see and hear her turned their senses towards her, expecting the imminent extraordinary event that would occur in that place.

However, nothing else happened.

Trixie, with her eyes fixed on the urn and a face frozen with excitement, waited for several seconds.

Nothing happened.

Nature, forgetting the previous shock, resumed its course.

“SERIOUSLY?!” Trixie exploded, her patience at its limit. Annoyed, she held the urn and began to shake it. “YOU COST ME 3 SCHOOL SALARIES AND SAVINGS ON FOOD EXPENSES FOR THEM! YOU BETTER BE USEFUL!” she shouted, frustrated. Irate, the unicorn started to press the urn with her magic in an attempt to open it.

A grave mistake. Such roughness was too much for that fragile relic.

Suddenly, amid the pressure Trixie was exerting with her magic, a crack opened on one side. Alarmed, Trixie immediately released her magical grip. But it was too late. Before she could do anything else, the walls of the urn collapsed and, like an egg hitting the ground, the remains of the relic fell into the grass, scattering in all directions.

What was once a valuable treasure of the ancient world was now just a pile of dust and broken clay.

A lonely breeze swept over the place where a stunned Trixie stood.

“Ahhhh,” Trixie broke the silence with a neigh full of rage, kicking the air. Although this behavior was unseemly for an adult mare like her, she had strong reasons to act this way. On her last trip, she had acquired that ancient urn at an auction at an exorbitant price, literally costing her the last savings and loans she had left. Despite being aware of the risk of that purchase, she had hoped to recoup the investment by reselling it on the black market in Canterlot.

Now she watched her investment dissolve into the wind amidst the pasture.

After rampaging for a long while, Trixie gradually calmed down. She exhaled several times until she finally took a serene breath and said:

“It's okay, Trixie, this was just a setback. The expensive urn you bought, which supposedly contained powerful ghosts capable of destroying entire kingdoms, turned out to be a scam. It’s not your fault, it’s the others who take advantage of you. Things like this happen to you often. Now let’s move on to something safer ...THE EXPLOSIVES!” Trixie shouted so loudly that her hat almost fell off, thus abruptly ending her stress-induced monologue; it was evident that she no longer wanted to think about her recent loss.

Thus, without more comfort than talking to herself, she began to move towards her trailer to...

Suddenly, a subtle “Paff” sounded in the air, and Trixie found herself sprawled on the ground. Surprised, she looked beneath her...

Her hind legs had tangled with a yellow paper. It was the same sealing talisman she had thrown away a moment ago.

She stood up and, in a reflex of pure rage, Trixie ripped the talisman off her legs with her magic and threw it against the barrier.

It made no noise upon impact. In an instant, the talisman consumed itself in a ball of green fire.

Trixie, paying it no more attention, turned her back disdainfully. All she had in mind was finding her C-4 explosives and preparing them to blow up the barrier.

However, where the talisman had previously burned, the resulting smoke began to slowly swirl, growing in size and depth...

------

[11:35 am]

Meanwhile... at Twilight's castle security post.

"... you should have more confidence, let Smolder handle it. Ha! She knows more about these gadgets than we do," said Gallus, moving a heavy stack of monitors.

"Yeah, I know, but... ahh I can’t believe this is happening right now!" replied Ocellus exasperated, searching through a box of spare parts.

"Problems always come up, though you really should have been more careful with the control panel."

"I didn’t think it was that fragile, and besides, you said the red button was to deactivate the barrier!"

"I said 'the red button is to deactivate the barrier, the red-red button is to further secure the doors.'"

"They look the same!"

"No, they don’t!"

"CAN YOU KEEP QUIET! I’m trying to concentrate," Smolder yelled furiously, sticking her head out from under the desk where a panel full of colorful buttons and tangled wires was installed. Without saying more, she put a screwdriver in her mouth and grabbed a nearby flashlight, then went back under the desk. In response to their companion’s words, Ocellus and Gallus stopped arguing and silently returned to their urgent tasks.

They couldn't forget they were in the middle of an emergency.

Outside the room, in the hallway, a worried Silverstream was looking at a screen showing the entrance to the castle. Despite the static caused by overextending the monitor cables, the images showing the outside were still recognizable.

Outside, the situation seemed to be getting worse.

Then, like a large rock coming down the stairs, Yona and Sandbar arrived, though it was more appropriate to say that Yona arrived with Sandbar clinging to her back.

As soon as Yona saw her friend, she ran towards her, announcing:

"COUNSELOR TRIXIE IS BACK! COUNSELOR TRIXIE IS BACK! COUNSELOR TRIXIE IS BACK!"

"WE ALREADY KNOW!" came a loud reply from inside the security post. Surprised by the firm response, Yona halted abruptly, stopping right in front of the security post door, almost on top of Silverstream. Now stopped, Yona and Sandbar, who didn’t understand what was happening, glanced inside the room.

Inside the room were Gallus, Ocellus, and Smolder, all of whom were focused on checking the castle's security system control panel. None of them looked away from the large tangle of cables before them, nor did they wear their usual friendly expressions. They looked more like a cold group of doctors trying to diagnose a gravely ill patient.

Puzzled, Yona and Sandbar turned their gazes to Silverstream, who was standing to the side. The obvious question they would ask was clear.

“What’s going on, Silvi?” Sandbar was the first to speak.

“Well, we’re experiencing serious technical problems with the castle’s defense system. Remember Gallus mentioned that all the security equipment was extremely delicate and we needed to be very careful with it? Well, it turns out it was more delicate than it seemed...” Silverstream responded, pointing to some burnt-out monitors that had been removed from inside. Not far away, there was a fire extinguisher.

“Wait... the control panel burned out? But if it’s like that, then the barrier and the doors are...” said Sandbar, who was still on Yona’s back.

“Totally sealed,” Silverstream finished the sentence with a grimace of distress.

Now Sandbar and Yona also understood how serious the situation was.

“FRIENDS, WHAT DO NOW?!” Yona exclaimed nervously, looking at the still working monitors.

“For now, the guys are trying to fix the panel with the spare parts we have. Smolder says she knows how to do it,” replied Silverstream.

“Wouldn’t asking for help be better?”

“That could make things worse, Yona,” Sandbar responded, swallowing hard, already imagining what would happen to them when Headmare Starlight found out.

“BUT COUNSELOR TRIXIE IS OUTSIDE, AND SHE IS VERY ANGRY!”

“It’s true! She was firing beams at the barrier! We should go out and talk to her,” added Sandbar.

“The others wanted to do that too, but then decided to fix the panel first...”

Interrupting what Silverstream was saying, another voice echoed loudly in the hallway.

“DONE, IT'S WORKING!” Smolder announced excitedly from inside the control post. “Just give the system a moment to finish rebooting.”

Finally, the tension that had gripped the trio of friends inside the security post began to dissipate. Then, before anyone could say anything else, Gallus quickly approached the rest of his friends who were at the entrance and asked, “How’s it looking outside?”

Silverstream immediately checked the monitor she was holding, her face growing distressed again.

“I think we have a new problem...” Silverstream replied nervously, pointing towards the darkness that loomed on the monitor screen.

------

Ghosts, in a world shaped by magic and inhabited by ponies, such entities were not nonexistent. From time immemorial, ghosts have always been a strongly rooted presence within the stories of common lore and arcane knowledge, often mentioned in a wide array of tales where they play a role as either a heroic support or a malevolent force.

However, despite the large number of stories involving such entities, it is difficult to know where they come from and what their true purpose in the world is. For example, there is the story of the ghost of a wise dragoness who appeared in a kingdom to protect it when it was at its most difficult moment. Another story is that of the malevolent desert spirit who poisoned a king's mind with unbridled ambition. Both tales, bordering on the fantastic, were not events that occurred in ancient times, but recent events that had been studied extensively. Of course, such studies could only corroborate the events that happened and could not obtain more information about the true identity of the apparitions.

Added to this was the problem that it was very difficult to encounter these entities and even more so to summon them.

Thus, the wisest can only conclude that ghosts rest on a plane beyond our own, probably being the watchers or instigators of stories that transcend beyond our own life or understanding.

The less wise, on the other hand, would simply have more stories with which to amaze the younger ones.

In all this, Trixie Lulamoon, a unicorn almost ignorant of these profound subjects, was about to become part of one of these stories...

[11:40 am]

"...these should be enough. I just have to be very careful not to drop them... or touch them. I’ve got too much spark in my hooves! Ha ha ha," Trixie laughed, delirious from the red potion she had drunk earlier.

She had just prepared her C-4 explosives. Behind her, the magical barrier protecting Twilight's castle shimmered imposingly.

"Just wait, Trixie's fireworks will surprise you all..." Trixie murmured to herself with a dark smile as she carefully placed the dangerous explosives in a box marked with her own face.

In her mind, Trixie already imagined how her explosives would blow up the castle's defenses. Then, she would make her triumphant entrance through the main gate, where she would encounter a frightened and regretful Young Six, take care of them, and finally meet Starlight, and then...

Trixie interrupted her thoughts, alerted by a strange feeling of being watched. She lowered her gaze and saw something she didn't expect.

In front of her, a few steps away, there was a small white rabbit watching her. It was a tiny, fluffy creature with a tenderness in its face that could move the heart of any pony.

But, to the darkened heart of the Great and Powerful Trixie, this was nothing more than an intruder prying into her personal affairs.

"SHOO! GET OUT!" the unicorn ordered angrily. However, the small white rabbit continued to watch her. Uncomfortable, Trixie pulled out a broom and prepared to chase it away.

Nevertheless, she stopped.

Upon closer inspection, Trixie suddenly perceived a deep feeling in that gaze, a sadness that struck deep within her. It was as if the rabbit reflected the great sorrow someone would feel upon seeing their best friend lost on the wrong path.

A brief flash of conscience shone in Trixie’s mind, but it was quickly suppressed by the corrupt red magic clouding her judgment.

"I'm doing the right thing! It’s a good plan! Starlight would do the same for me!" Trixie shouted angrily at the rabbit, her eyes reddened. Then, consumed by the hostility filling her, she threw the broom to one side of the rabbit.

But the rabbit did not change its stance and continued to cast that accusatory look. Trixie snorted.

"What do rabbits know about friendship!" Trixie mocked with deep disdain. Taking her box of explosives, she turned her back on the rabbit and set off to place the bombs around the castle's magical barrier.

But she didn’t; she stopped again.

She had been wrong; the harmless rabbit from before had not been looking at her, but at the supernatural presence that had emerged beyond her.

Dropping the box of explosives she was carrying (fortunately, they didn’t explode), Trixie opened her mouth and eyes wide, gazing at the apparitions that had appeared behind her a moment ago.

Six figures, resembling equine specters, stood materialized before her. A dark, shifting mist enveloped them, creating the impression of a portal to a cosmos of shadows. These spectral figures, with expressions varying between smiling and stern, with eyes shining like cemetery lanterns, stood firm in their ethereal presence. Each was clad in personalized armor and unique ghostly attire, indicating different roles among them. Despite their heterogeneous appearances, they all shared the same mark: resembling the runes representing the sun and moon, hanging from their flanks, a symbol that manifested their profound unity.

They were, undoubtedly, a presence that would intimidate anyone.

Trixie, who had remained silent for a while trying to process what was happening, watched as the tallest figure advanced towards her with a gallant and threatening step, bowing before her with the same elegance a knight would show their ruler.

"The guardians of Eulfalia present themselves before you, oh great and powerful summoner! We eagerly await to fulfill your will," announced the specter in a martial voice, head bowed, touching the ground.

It was very curious. Despite its imposing figure, the voice of the powerful specter turned out to be ordinary and feminine, which contrasted with expectations. But putting that aside...

"...great and powerful summoner?" Trixie only needed a moment to understand, and then she let out an excited neigh. "Hiiiii!"

Unable to contain herself, Trixie waved her hooves in the air with euphoria at the incredible reality before her.

In an extraordinary and unpredictable event, Trixie Lulamoon had summoned the powerful and heroic guardians of the forgotten lands of Eulfalia, a mythical team of specters who had remained sealed in an ancient (and excessively expensive) urn that she had accidentally broken moments earlier.

Possessed by the excitement of her success, the unicorn celebrated with laughter and capers. However, she soon stopped; the cold aura emanating from that ghostly group reminded her of the urgent situation she was in. She coughed for a moment and tried to maintain her composure as best she could; she thought that if these ghosts were really under her orders, she had to show herself worthy before them. For someone like her, who lived by her image and words, that should be easy...

Trixie swirled her cape and adjusted her hat, adopting a pose that shrouded her in mystery. With an arrogant and determined look, she presented herself to the ghosts.

"Ahem... Greetings, my subjects! It is I, the one and only, the extraordinary, the Great and Powerful Trixie!" she proclaimed with pride, her voice resonating with the magnificence that characterized her.

The leader of the specters, who had previously bowed, raised her head attentively. Behind her, the expressions on the nebulous faces of her fellow ghosts turned serious in unison, all fixing their bright eyes on Trixie and showing their dedication to every word of their new mistress.

Feeling the power emanating from their devoted gazes, Trixie's heart swelled with satisfaction. Convinced of their loyalty, she let the words flow freely.

"Do not be surprised! Today, the great Trixie has been the victim of an unparalleled atrocity. Despite being so humble and generous with others, she has been denied access to her own home. And, to top it off! She has been forbidden from meeting the best friend a pony could wish for. So, you, my loyal guardians of Eulfalia, have the obligation to put an end to this injustice. This magical barrier surrounding this castle, my glorious home!, must disappear. I order you to use your immense power to undo it and let me in! Let your energies wear down and dissipate this obstacle, opening the way for the triumphant entry of the great Trixie so she can finally reunite with the friend she most treasures!" Trixie proclaimed gallantly, her cape fluttering in the wind as she pointed to the imposing luminous barrier shining behind the specters.

What the heck had all that been? Not even Trixie knew exactly what she was talking about. She had never heard of "the guardians of Eulfalia". She was simply playing along. She knew that the ancient urn she had acquired contained a powerful group of ghosts, but nothing more.

To all this, she wasn't sure what the ghosts would actually do now that she had ordered them to destroy the barrier.

Just when a bead of worry began to fall from her forehead, Trixie watched as the "guardians of Eulfalia" solemnly nodded, accepting the order she had given them. Relieved and somewhat surprised, she saw the specters slowly rise into the sky and position themselves at the highest part of the magical barrier protecting Twilight's castle.

Slowly, the atmosphere over the castle began to change; the air filled with tension as the mysterious magic of the specters intensified. On the ground, Trixie watched with bright eyes, expectant of what might happen.

"Oummmmm... dooo..., Oummmmm...reee..., Oummmmm... miii..., Oummmmm... faaa..., Oummmmm... solll..., Oummmmm... laaa..."

It was bewildering.

For several minutes, the specters began chanting from above. Trixie, who could hear perfectly well, couldn’t understand why they were singing. She expected an explosion or some kind of powerful magic manifestation, with lights and flashes. Not ceremonial chants.

“Is this part of a ritual?” Trixie murmured, scratching her head.

This kind of magic felt strange to her. She had heard about ceremonies like these and knew that ponies used to practice them frequently in the distant past, but they were extraordinarily rare nowadays. Perhaps they were still practiced in the Crystal Empire, where such extravagant customs were preserved.

As she carefully watched the ghosts in the middle of their ritual, she noticed something unusual and surprisingly familiar. The dark manes of several of the ghosts resembled those of Princess Twilight’s friends. One of them even wore a hat similar to Applejack’s, which clashed with the armor of her companions...

“OUMMMMM... SYYYYYY!” Suddenly, Trixie’s reflections were interrupted by an intense proclamation heard from above. The tension that had filled the air dissolved into a profound silence.

The spectral guardians of Eulfalia began to descend. Their ritual had ended.

The magical barrier around Twilight’s castle was still intact.

Below, Trixie watched them descend with an indifferent expression, like a dissatisfied customer receiving a long-awaited but disappointing product.

Finally, after an overly dramatic descent, all the specters touched the ground in a perfect formation.

Without wasting a second, Trixie approached them.

“I see, I see... you finished singing and all that,” she said casually, approaching the leader of the ghosts. “Now, could you do me the small favor of explaining. WHAT WAS ALL THAT?!” she exploded with indignation, pointing her hoof at the magical barrier that the powerful specters were supposed to have destroyed.

However, the guardians of Eulfalia didn’t respond. Instead, they quickly took a new formation. Dividing into two groups of three, they lined up on either side of the path, just as the royal guards of Canterlot would do to clear the way for royalty.

Before Trixie could say anything, the leader of the guardians of Eulfalia raised her spectral hoof to the sky and, like the conductor of an orchestra, elegantly swung it down while bowing.

Trixie was puzzled. She wasn’t sure, but... it was as if they were showing her the way.

Then, unexpectedly, she saw the ground beneath her hooves fill with small red flowers. Magically, the flowers advanced along the path towards the castle like a rolling red carpet, reaching the magical barrier and then...

In a blink of an eye, the magical barrier dissipated, as easily as if it were a simple soap bubble.

Trixie was no longer puzzled; she was astonished. No, she was shocked. But it wasn’t over yet.

The flower path continued advancing towards the castle. Upon arrival, the entrance was filled with large ornamental flowers adorning the doors, which opened wide to welcome her. At the same time, an inexplicable ceremonial melody began to play, while rose petals fell from the sky and a unique fragrance spread through the air.

Trixie was no longer thinking; she was ecstatic, forgetting all her previous insecurities. She now understood the display of pomp; there was no doubt. It was a royal procession.

“Ah, of course. They were just doing exactly what I asked them to. How considerate! And quiet... and weird. I like it!” Trixie, with a radiant smile, let herself be carried away and began to proudly parade down the flower carpet. Although she initially thought of entering the castle immediately once the ghosts had finished their task, with such a loyal audience watching her, she couldn’t help but show off just ‘a little.’

Thus, with a regal step and without taking her eyes off the castle entrance, Trixie confidently advanced down the red carpet of flowers. However, as she got closer to her destination, the anxiety inside her grew. After several steps, Trixie began to trot faster, losing the elegance in her stride.

“So close...” a pressing feeling of urgency invaded Trixie. She no longer cared what the ghosts she had summoned thought or the unnecessary royal procession. What mattered to her was meeting Starlight just...

Suddenly, a subtle “Paff” echoed in the air, and Trixie found herself sprawled on the ground. Surprised, she looked under herself...

She had tripped over a cider bottle.

“Seriously!” she got up and, in a pure rage reflex, took the bottle with her magic and threw it far, beyond the hill.

Just as before, she had tripped again. However, this time, something else happened.

“Jijijiji,” a laugh echoed loudly around. The solemnity of the royal procession was broken, and a disgusted Trixie turned her gaze.

One of the ghosts, the least intimidating-looking of them all, laughed animatedly at Trixie’s clumsiness. It wasn’t a sepulchral or malevolent laugh, but one of pure amusement.

“Ha, ha, very funny. Is it so amusing to see your mistress on the ground?” Trixie scolded, shaking off the flower petals stuck to her cape.

“Ji, ji, ji... Oh! Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you, your excellency! It won’t happen again!” surprised by her behavior, the once cheerful ghost returned to a rigid and serious posture along with her companions.

“I hope so because I, the great and powerful Trix...” Trixie stopped silently, about to give another speech when something else caught her attention.

The other ghosts, who had previously maintained expressionless faces, now showed a single emotion on their nebulous faces.

Amazed, they all stared at their companion.

A breeze of wind crossed amidst the confusion reigning at the doors of Twilight’s castle. The ghosts that Trixie had summoned with so much effort and trouble, the guardians of Eulfalia, no longer looked or thought of their summoner, but of the revelation that had arisen before them.

“Hm, girls, what’s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?” asked the ghost who was the object of her companions’ gazes.

“How could you laugh, Electrina?” asked one of her companions with a cold look.

“Hee, I’m sorry, I couldn’t help it I just...”

“This shouldn’t be possible,” interrupted the leader. “Since we were cursed by Dhona Oleg-Nar Dhazer, all our emotions were sealed, as well as our freedom to act on our own will. It has been so ever since. That you were able to laugh on your own means the curse has weakened enough or is broken, which would only be possible if we were to find ourselves during the midday of...”

The leader of the ghosts of Eulfalia didn’t finish speaking. An unprecedented possibility floated in the air, a possibility that had been immediately understood by all.

All, except Trixie, who didn’t understand anything that was happening.

“What day is today?” the leader asked her companions sharply. Without waiting for an answer, she looked up and observed the midday sun rising high.

It was the longest day of the year, the summer solstice, reaching its peak in the sky.

Trixie, still not understanding what was happening, watched nervously as the cold face of the leader of the guardians of Eulfalia broke into a broad smile like a bright sword cutting through the darkness.

Watching the castle gates from afar, the unknown presence hidden among the plants began to prepare.

I could feel it... the moment was approaching.
