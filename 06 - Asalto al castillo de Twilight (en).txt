In the Twilight Castle, in the grand map room, the lone circular table placed at its center shimmered, vividly reflecting the distant image of a mare with blue fur and a white mane, trotting while wearing a colorful wizard hat.

Seated in the most prominent chair among the six surrounding the magical table, Starlight Glimmer furrowed her brow. She set aside the scrolls she was reviewing and approached to examine the image. Soon, she recognized the mare rapidly approaching.

"Why is she here? Why is she coming in such a hurry?" she thought, puzzled. An obvious answer crossed her mind, putting her on guard. "Has she discovered me?"

It shouldn't be possible, considering all the countermeasures she had taken... or could it be...

The sudden doubt that erupted in her mind faded away. There was another answer that could better explain what was happening. If she considered everything she had investigated and learned from the unexpected visit of the younger bearers of the Elements of Harmony that morning, then she could conclude that what was happening now was a consequence of the actions taken by the 'previous' Starlight.

"Ugh, how annoying. I've had enough of these trivialities..." murmured Starlight, losing all interest. She had already spent too much of her limited time attending to the Young Six; it was time to bring her duties to an end...

With just a shake of one of her hooves, the scrolls on the table vanished along with the image of the approaching mare. Next, Starlight tossed a small crystal into the center of the table, and it lit up.

A dark silhouette was holographically projected in the middle of the table.

Starlight bowed and said, "The first passenger has boarded."

"Blessed tide. The other passengers have also boarded smoothly; let's proceed with the next phase immediately," announced an unknown voice.

"Excellent, I'm sending you my coordinates."

Starlight pulled out another crystal, and it flickered for a few seconds, just like on the side of the dark projection.

"Everything is in order..." announced the unknown voice as the glow between crystals subsided. "THE TRAIN DEPARTS FROM THE STATION!"

"See you at midnight," replied the lavender-maned unicorn.

The hologram faded away, leaving Starlight alone in the room.

She rose from her seat and cast a playful glance at the star-shaped emblem glowing on the chair where she had been sitting. Then, a big smile appeared on her face; this was not a friendly smile...

"The greatest victories are achieved before the first battle is even fought... hehe... Checkmate, princess...", said Starlight before disappearing in a teleportation light.

----------

From one of the balconies of Twilight Castle, Ocellus observed with great interest the illuminated horizon of that sunny morning through a telescope.

A large cloud was moving slowly in the distance.

"It looks like a storm cloud from the Everfree Forest..." Ocellus murmured, puzzled.

"Is something wrong, Ocellus?" replied Gallus, facing away, flexing his wings at the opposite end of the balcony.

"Oh, it's nothing important! Well, maybe it is... Tell me, Gallus, what do you think of that cloud?"

Gallus turned around and directed his gaze toward the horizon in the same direction Ocellus was pointing. After squinting to sharpen his sight, he spread his wings and, with a flap, soared into the air to surpass the height of the castle.

After a few seconds in the sky, he returned to the balcony.

"Well, what can I say, it's definitely unusual weather from the Everfree Forest. Looks like a storm cloud moving northeast."

"Oh no! That's not good. They predicted sunny weather for the entire Canterlot outskirts. I have to report this immediately."

"Hey, aren't you being a bit too diligent? The weather guys must have it covered. Besides, it's moving northeast. There's nothing there, except the train tracks."

"Regardless, someone has to warn them," Ocellus replied, pulling out parchment and a quill.

"Haha, couldn't expect any less from the future 'teacher' Ocellus," Gallus teased.

Ocellus, about to write, halted her quill and looked at Gallus in surprise.

Gallus, who was about to munch on a corn snack, froze upon realizing the serious slip-up he had made.

"Did you read my diary?" Ocellus asked, frowning.

"Aaa... I just remembered I didn't lock the security booth door, better go back before the guys do something stupid..."

"YOU READ MY DIARY, GALLUS?!" Ocellus exclaimed, raising her voice and standing up indignantly.

"Haaa well..." Nervous, Gallus glanced toward the balcony entrance, already thinking about escaping from that place. At that moment, the rest of their friends arrived alerted by Ocellus's voice. They were quite surprised to see the scene; that sudden anger in Ocellus was very unusual for her.

Gallus, uneasy about not knowing how to respond, remained silent, slowly stepping back towards the others.

Then, Smolder, understanding what was happening, spoke up.

"He didn't read your diary, Ocellus, it was me," said Smolder, very serious and in a firm stance.

"What?" exclaimed Ocellus, surprised by the sudden revelation.

"It was shortly after the orchid-octopus invasion, while we were cleaning the flooded school dorms, I found a diary among the trash. I didn't know it was yours, so I kept it and started reading. I found it quite amusing, so I also shared it with the rest of the gang. That's when Yona and Silverstream told me it was yours."

The shocked Ocellus was still processing what her friend had just told her. Weeks ago, she had found her diary in the lost documents section of the library. She was puzzled about how it had ended up there after losing it during the orchid-octopus invasion. Although her friends had told her before that they couldn't find it during the school cleanup, it was now clear that it had not been true.

Her surprise quickly gave way to another, more obvious concern.

"How much did you read from my diary?" Ocellus asked, already fearing the response her companions might give.

"No, no, no. We didn't find out much, really! Just your big... I mean, little dream of becoming a teacher..." said Silverstream, somewhat nervously.

"And the long poems dedicated to the former headmistress Twilight to make her come back to school," added Yona.

Ocellus, now embarrassed, blushed at the mixed expressions of her friends.

"It was an accident, Ocellus. It wasn't intentional. We would never spy on someone else's private diary."

"But you did spy on Sandbar's," corrected Smolder with a suspicious look.

"That was a bet, it's different," Gallus replied immediately.

"Enough, guys. Ocellus, are you okay?" interrupted Sandbar, wheeling forward, noticing the distress in Ocellus.

Ocellus hadn't said anything until that moment. Her heart was cold, and her thoughts were elsewhere, in the midst of a dark suspicion.

"Are you upset with us?" Silverstream asked.

"No. Well, I understand it was an accident, so it's okay, I forgive you," Ocellus responded mechanically, indicating a complete lack of enthusiasm in her words.

"Phew, what a relief, guys. Everything's fine!" Silverstream happily replied to the others but held back upon noticing the concern in the rest of her teammates.

Soon, she too became concerned, noticing the cold expression on Ocellus's face.

"Okay, you forgive us, but there's still something bothering you," Smolder said, breaking the chilly atmosphere.

"It's nothing," Ocellus replied.

"Come on, if you're really upset with me, I can accept any punishment you give me."

"It's not that."

"Then what is it?"

"Well, it's kind of silly, but... for a moment, I thought you were just being so nice to me and helping me with the school trip just because you didn't want me to find out what had happened with my diary," Ocellus said with evident sadness.

Silence filled the balcony.

"Hey! Of course not, we really care about the trip," Smolder responded, approaching her friend. "And yes, we felt a bit guilty at first, but we genuinely care about what you're doing, and you matter more, Ocellus."

Everyone else nodded in agreement, confirming Smolder's words.

Then, finally, a relieved smile appeared on Ocellus's face as she sensed the honesty in her friend's words. Soon, the cold feelings that had momentarily paralyzed her heart melted away, and she was herself again.

"Thanks, guys, I'm really glad to hear that," Ocellus responded genuinely uplifted.

"We're glad we didn't know more about your diary. Ouch!" Gallus said but was interrupted by a nudge from Sandbar.

The group of friends laughed again, everything was back to normal.

"Don't you feel like something's missing?" Silverstream asked, suddenly stopping her laughter.

The answer came quickly.

"Group hug!" Yona bellowed to her friends.

"Now? Ugh!" Gallus exclaimed, being pulled off the ground by Yona when he tried to escape. In an instant, everyone was caught in a tight Yak-style hug in the middle of the balcony.

"Ouch, ouch, ouch, Yona... that's enough!" exclaimed Ocellus, feeling her exoskeleton starting to be compressed.

The hug ended at that moment; Yona released her friends, who couldn't help but take a deep breath to recover lost air.

"Haaa... Well, I think that was enough friendship dosage for one day. If you need me, I'll be in the storeroom..." said Gallus, recovering from his friend's powerful hug.

"WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?" shouted Smolder, raising her voice at Gallus, who was already re-entering the castle.

"Eh? I didn't say, I'm going to the storeroom..."

"Is that so? Don't you forget something?"

"What could it be?"

"Perhaps a certain griffon with a feather memory doesn't remember making a 'dragon's vow' to his friends that he would never speak about a certain diary for the rest of his life," said Smolder with a gaze befitting a dragon who had had its treasure stolen. Beside her, the surprised Ocellus watched what was happening.

"Come on. We've already moved past that," replied Gallus.

"You made a dragon's vow!" exclaimed Smolder, pointing her claw at Gallus.

"I really don't care, Smolder," said Ocellus, trying to calm her friends; she already suspected what was going on.

"He has to pay for his mistake, Ocellus," roared Smolder, who was not willing to back down from her stance. Ocellus turned to the rest of her friends for help, but their looks were stern.

"Yaks never break their word. Understand dragon vow very well. Vow must be respected," said Yona solemnly; beside her, Silverstream and Sandbar nodded at her words, showing they shared her position.

"Seriously, guys!" Gallus complained seeing how his friends had turned against him.

"Is there any way to fix this?" Ocellus asked, already concerned about how the situation was evolving.

"Well, yes, there's one way or another to fix it. But the main one is that he has to endure a punishment!" declared Smolder.

"A punishment?" Ocellus repeated; she didn't like the idea. Gallus seemed equally displeased, and he now furrowed his brow in annoyance.

"Uhh, I know! He could shave the feathers on his head before graduation," suggested Silverstream cheerfully.

"Hey, hey, that's not fair!" exclaimed an indignant Gallus.

"They won't do that, right?" Ocellus asked Smolder, concerned.

"Of course not. The punishment has to be chosen by the aggrieved party. In this case, 'you' have to decide," Smolder responded to Ocellus.

All eyes turned to the shy changeling.

"Heeee!" exclaimed Ocellus nervously. "I can't do that; he is..."

Gallus sighed, already resigned. "It's okay, Ocellus. Give me a punishment, and it's fine by me."

"But, Gallus..." said Ocellus, unsure of what she should do; then, she turned her gaze back to Smolder. "You said there were other ways, right?"

"Yes. The other is that he spends a hundred moons trapped inside a volcano," Smolder responded with a malicious smile. Ocellus swallowed, aware that Gallus wouldn't last even a day in a place like that.

"Ocellus, it's okay. I deserve it for being a bigmouth. Now give me a punishment and let's get this over with once and for all," said Gallus, no longer interested in continuing that conversation.

Ocellus sighed tiredly. A moment ago, they had just shared a friendship hug. Now she would have to sentence her friend Gallus. Did friendship really work this way? Did former Headmistress Twilight go through situations like this with her friends? Or was this just something unique to them?

"I need to have private lessons with Princess Twilight in the future, I..." thought Ocellus disheartened.

Then, an idea came to her mind.

"Gallus, this will be your punishment. You must tell all of us, with total honesty and truth, what you want to be in the future," Ocellus spoke aloud, with no shyness in her words.

Gallus didn't laugh. Neither did the rest of the Young Six. None of them truly knew the answer to that question. For a long time, Gallus had avoided answering his friends when they asked about that topic. And when he did answer, it was always in jest, so no one could really take his words seriously.

Now Gallus was forced to answer. The Young Six watched him with great interest.

The blue-feathered griffon looked up at the sky with his thoughts in the clouds. After being silent for a brief moment, he finally turned his gaze back to the ground, towards his friends on the balcony.

"I wish to be an adventurer. Travel like no griffon has ever done, learn about the lives of other griffons in colonies around the world, broaden my horizons, and bring all the knowledge I gain back to Griffonstone to make it a better place," responded Gallus in a serious and mature tone.

The wind gently crossed the balcony. There, the Young Six were left speechless by Gallus's surprising answer. No one had expected that response.

"Wow. It's very noble of you to want to do all this for your home," replied Ocellus, breaking the stupor of her companions.

"Well... it's not that I feel indebted to the other griffons in the colony. But if it's possible to make the place where you live better, why not do it?" said Gallus, shrugging.

"You have our full support!" said Sandbar in his wheelchair, also in a serious tone. Beside him, the rest of the Young Six nodded in agreement with his words.

"Thanks, bro," responded Gallus; both approached, claw and hoof collided in a friendly gesture.

The sun shone brightly over the Friendship Castle. A true group of friends stood defiantly on one of its balconies. And so they continued chatting among themselves for a few more minutes until...

"Oh, I just remembered. We found a manticore in the castle basement. Do you want to go see it?" Silverstream said excitedly, suddenly remembering why they had returned to the balcony before the discussion with Ocellus.

"Really? That's..." replied Gallus but was interrupted. A sudden screech reached them from inside the castle.

The sound was so shrill and powerful that it made everyone cover their ears.

"Annoying noise! Where is it coming from?" grumbled Yona, trying to cover her large and sensitive ears.

"It's the intruder alert in case of an attack!" Gallus responded loudly so his friends could hear him over the noise.

"HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" they all responded in unison.
