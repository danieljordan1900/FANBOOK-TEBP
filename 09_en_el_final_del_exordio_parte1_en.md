Time was running out.

//---------

Several minutes had passed since the turkey-hawks had left. At the gates of Twilight's castle, Trixie and the Young Six found themselves in the middle of a… 'difficult' encounter.

"...it's really been a rough day," Ocellus finished saying.

"Yeah, tell me about it. All those turkey-hawks, crazy stuff...," Trixie laughed, somewhat awkwardly.

"Yeah, really crazy... Who could’ve called them?" Gallus added in a low voice, but despite the fruitless conversation, it was clearly heard.

Everyone immediately turned to look at Gallus, feeling uncomfortable, but he didn’t seem to care and kept looking away.

Trixie had already noticed this behavior before. It was not a good sign.

("Is he upset with me? Did I do something to him today? Think, Trixie! Think!") Ever since she woke up with barely any memory, surrounded by turkey-hawks, Trixie had been straining her brain to make sense of why she was in that situation.

After checking through her cape and hat, finding a large amount of cider bottles and poorly stored pumpkin pie bags, Trixie came to the only logical conclusion: 'maybe' she might have 'slightly' lost control after the crazy party the night before.

But in situations like that, she was supposed to rely on Starlight as a safety net...

("Darn it, Starlight, you swore you’d watch over me when I had too much cider!") she blamed her friend in her thoughts. With her memories incomplete, the clueless Trixie remained silent, imagining possibilities, not realizing she was being watched.

"Counselor Trixie, are you alright?" Ocellus asked, noticing Trixie’s suspicious behavior.

"Yes, yes, everything's fine," Trixie quickly replied, trying hard to maintain a calm image. "Oh, by the way, where is Starlight?"

"She’s not here," Smolder responded immediately, very seriously.

"She’s not?" Trixie repeated, a chill running down her spine. ("Then that means...") she thought to herself.

"Vice Principal Sunburst isn’t here either," added Sandbar from his wheelchair, also serious.

"Hoo, I see..." Trixie replied with a falsely calm tone. ("SUNBURST TOO!") she screamed internally, panicking.

Panic flooded Trixie; amid her flawed reasoning, memories of going through something similar before hit her like rocks.

Many moons ago, Trixie and Starlight had gone to a charity event in Manehattan, where, after meeting many ponies, they ended up being invited to a big party at the most popular nightclub in the city. With nothing to lose, just wanting to have fun, both friends ended up going to that place.

When they woke up the next day (with no memory of the previous night), they found themselves very close together in bed, in Maud’s room, with a tied-up Sunburst trapped in the bathroom of the house. Ignoring the Princess Twilight costume Trixie was wearing, Starlight’s military uniform, the chains on Sunburst, and the large number of cider bottles on the floor, the group of friends (including Maud) swore never to mention that incident in their lives again.

("The cider, it's always the cider...") now certain of what was really going on, Trixie took the initiative before anyone else could speak.

 "...Alright, I know you have a lot of questions, but for such an important conversation, it’s better to have a good setting. Let’s go inside first. Does that sound good?" proposed Trixie in a very mature tone, pointing toward the castle. She wasn’t saying it because she actually wanted to continue that conversation; she wanted to escape. But her friends were in trouble, and even if it wasn’t her fault, she had to take responsibility.

She had to protect the respectable image of her friends in front of the students. (As adults who had no problems with cider).

After Trixie’s suggestion, the Young Six exchanged confused glances.

"Okay..." Sandbar finally replied, doubtful and tired. The rest of his friends silently nodded.

Internally, Trixie almost jumped with excitement; she still had control of the situation. Now that she was in charge, she had to be very careful with her next move. She needed to find out more about what happened that morning without drawing too much attention...

"Alright, let’s head inside then," she said confidently, and led the group toward the castle.

The others, very tired, followed... except Ocellus.

"Counselor Trixie," Ocellus’s firm voice was heard from behind. The young changeling hadn’t moved from her spot, and Trixie, halfway up the steps, stopped and turned to look at her, followed by the others.

"Is something wrong, dear?" Trixie asked, trying to keep her carefree tone.

"Did you really...?"

Just as Ocellus was about to finish her question, she was interrupted.

A loud creaking noise, like a pipe being adjusted, echoed around them. For a moment, they all froze and, filled with anxiety, looked up at the sky, fearing that a new disaster was about to fall upon them.

Fortunately, it wasn’t. The creaking sound happened again, and they all turned their attention to the source, which was much closer.

In the middle of the group of friends, a guilty-looking Yona returned their stares.

"Yona not have lunch yet."

She wasn’t the only one.

Other stomach growls followed Yona’s.

None of the Young Six had eaten. The constant incidents of the day had deprived them of a normal lunch.

"I see..." Trixie responded, also realizing her own hunger. "What were you going to ask, Ocellus?"

"Uhmm, never mind..." the changeling replied, suddenly unsure.

"Alright... then, first stop: the dining hall!" Trixie resumed her path with determination.

And so, finally, after a hellish day full of mishaps, Trixie, accompanied by the Young Six, entered Twilight’s castle.

And just after crossing the doors, she decided to make her next move.

"Ehmm... Silverstream, dear," Trixie said without turning around.

"Yes?" responded the hippogriff, peeking from behind the group.

"Could you tell me about your day... in ‘great detail’?" the unicorn asked, emphasizing her last words.

"In ‘great detail’?" Silverstream repeated, unsure. "Umm... I’m sorry, Counselor Trixie, I don’t think I can. I have an academic order to stop being so detailed when giving explanations."

"Really? And who gave you that order?"

"I think it was you who told me that..."

"Did I really?!" Trixie replied sharply, before quickly returning to her feigned professionalism. "Ah, yes, right, dear, but today I feel very open to listening, so don’t worry, just go ahead."

"Really? Yay!" the hippogriff suddenly squealed, flapping her wings with excitement. "So... this morning, when I woke up, I saw the sun, and it seemed less yellow than usual, which was kind of weird, and then when I went to take a bath, I sneezed three and a half times before getting into the water, which is bad luck for hippogriffs..."

Silverstream continued talking quickly and almost without taking a breath. Ahead of her, the bored expressions of her friends grew heavier; meanwhile, Trixie smiled with satisfaction.

With a completely wrong idea of the situation, Trixie marched on toward her destination.

Behind her, the doors closed for the last time that day.

// -----------------

"...so we searched and searched all over the castle for Vice Principal Sunburst, but there was no trace of him. The friend that the Vice Principal brought along helped us too... what was her name? Derpy? I can’t quite remember her name, but I do remember her leather jacket. It was divine! I should ask her where she got it the next time I see her. Now that I think about it, we haven’t seen her since... maybe she went home. Yes, she definitely must’ve done that! As I was saying, we searched and searched until we gathered by the castle’s entrance. Then Gallus showed up and told us that the evil turkey-hawks had eaten her. By the pearl! I felt like my feathers were falling out at that moment!"

Silverstream hadn’t stopped talking, even after several of her friends had finished their lunch. At the dining table, only Trixie, Yona, Sandbar, and Silverstream remained. The latter hadn’t even touched her food; her bowl of seaweed cereal with sea cucumber milk sat untouched. No one had pointed it out to her, least of all Trixie, who was absorbed in processing all the information the young hippogriff was delivering.

"Uh-huh..." Trixie murmured, sipping from an already empty cup.

"Counselor Trixie, uhmm... do you want more juice?" Yona asked, noticing the empty cup she was holding.

"Uh-huh..." the unicorn replied mechanically. She had been like this for quite a few minutes.

Yona filled her cup, and also Sandbar’s, who watched the scene with growing concern, especially Trixie. Before leaving the dining hall, Ocellus and the others had privately asked him to keep an eye on her and report if she did anything strange.

("Do something strange?") Sandbar thought anxiously. Even someone like him couldn’t help but think that everything related to Trixie that day was strange.

"...so you said, 'so don’t worry, just do it,' and here we are, although now that I think about it... shouldn’t I also mention what the others might be thinking? Oh, I’m sorry! I’ll start again!"

"That’s enough, dear Silverstream... thank you for everything," Trixie said, suddenly raising her hoof.

"Ahh, thank you, Counselor Trixie. Talking always helps me relieve stress, and with everything that’s happened today, I felt like I was about to explode!" Silverstream finished before her stomach growled. "Hahaha, did I say explode? Maybe I meant implode? Haha, if you’ll excuse me..."

Without another word, Silverstream began devouring her bowl like a starving pig. Trixie, for her part, didn’t seem to notice. Staring blankly at the ceiling, she downed the juice from her cup in one gulp. Then, she leaned back in her seat, letting out such a loud sigh that it whistled through the room. Yona, Sandbar, and Silverstream (who had almost finished her bowl) turned their gaze toward her.

"Are you okay?" Sandbar asked, just as worried as the others.

"No!" Trixie answered sharply.

"Is that because...?"

"No... I don’t understand. Did I really do all that?" Trixie interrupted, her eyes distant. "Last night I went to Maud’s party, I remember drinking cider, I don’t know how much, but... but Starlight was with me! We went back together! And then... what happened this morning... aughh."

She brought her hooves to her head, her face contorting as if she were focusing all her energy on the mere act of thinking. She stayed with her eyes closed for several seconds until her hooves finally dropped, exhausted. A worn-out Trixie, already defeated, finally looked at her students. It almost seemed like smoke was coming out of her head. She had exhausted her mental strength in the futile effort of retrieving memories that no longer existed. Now, in this moment of weakness, her façade of a professional adult was completely shattered.

The Young Six weren’t children. They could see her and think for themselves. Even someone as constantly distracted as Silverstream could reason through what was happening and say it.

And she did...

"Counselor Trixie, you... don’t remember anything from this morning?"

Slowly, Trixie nodded, with no expression on her tired face. The Young Six looked at each other, confused.

"But how...? You already spoke with Silverstream just a few hours ago, you even argued with Ocellus," Sandbar questioned, just as incredulous as the others.

"I don’t know anything about that!" Trixie responded, cornered. "I... when I woke up this morning, I was outside the castle... on a bed of sand and feathers! Surrounded by turkey-hawks! I have no idea how I ended up there! And before that... I can’t remember anything. I’m telling you the truth!" Trixie finished, almost pleading.

"But Counselor said earlier that you understood what was going on..." Yona pointed out.

"I was acting!" Trixie snapped angrily, only to sink back into a slump.

Neither Sandbar, Yona, nor Silverstream knew what to say. Trixie’s shocking confession was hard to believe, but the intensity of her voice and expressions felt undeniably genuine. In truth, Trixie wasn’t acting. These were her real feelings, now fully exposed.

Silence filled the dining hall. At one end of the table, a downcast Trixie stared at the floor, looking like a child caught after a misdeed. On the other side, the Young Six reflected uncomfortably on what to do next; being in the role of adults definitely didn’t suit the three of them.

"BEEP, BEEP, BEEP..." A faint alarm sound broke the silence, catching everyone’s attention.

Yona checked her bag and turned off the alarm on her watch.

"It’s time for medicine."

"Already? I’d completely forgotten. Thanks for reminding me, Yona," Sandbar said.

"Don’t worry, Yona will prepare a cup of warm water for friend to take them."

Without saying more, Yona rummaged through the bag behind Sandbar’s wheelchair, pulled out a blister pack of pills, placed them on the table, and then began preparing the warm water her friend would need to take them.

Still in silence, Trixie watched this with concern while Silverstream quickly finished her meal. The voracious hippogriff had no intention of wasting this timely interruption.

That’s when it happened.

Unconsciously, perhaps out of her innate curiosity, or maybe her brain was trying to find a distraction from the intense stress she was under. Whatever the reason, Trixie then asked the most important question of the day.

"Why is Sandbar in a wheelchair?"

There was a moment of silence.

"Uhm... I had an accident during..." Sandbar began to answer in his typically soft voice.

Unfortunately for Sandbar, it was precisely because of this that he was ignored.

Silverstream, who was sitting closer and had just finished her lunch, eagerly jumped in to answer Trixie’s question.

"It’s because Gallus broke his legs during the invasion of the Orchid-Octopi a few weeks ago. Those monsters got inside his head and turned him evil. It was awful! He started attacking everyone and giving villain speeches. Princess Cadance fought him and defeated him, but he escaped with those monsters into the forest. That’s when Gallus managed to catch up to him and captured him to free him from the mind control. It wasn’t pretty when..."

Silverstream stopped in the middle of her monologue, noticing the shocked stares directed at her.

The hippogriff had said too much.

"Oops... I shouldn’t have said that. Haha... sorry." Silverstream began sinking into her seat, realizing her serious slip-up.

While her friends looked at her awkwardly, Trixie continued.

"That happened during my absence... the invasion of the Orchid-Octopi, right?" she asked, lost in thought.

"Yes, that unfortunately happened," Sandbar confirmed, not very enthusiastically. "But don’t worry, Counselor Trixie. I’m doing better now and I’ll start my rehabilitation next week. Besides, all the Orchid-Octopi were captured, though the forest is still under quarantine. There haven’t been any recent incidents, so it’s likely that there aren’t any left."

When he finished speaking, Yona and Silverstream nodded, confirming their friend’s reassuring words.

But a new emotion, far from reassuring, began to flood Trixie. In the whirlwind of thoughts swirling in her mind, a face came to her as if in revelation...

Gallus.

Pushing aside her own worries, Trixie stood up and, very seriously, walked over to Sandbar.

"Tell me everything that happened..." In a complete role reversal, Trixie asked in an undeniably adult tone.
